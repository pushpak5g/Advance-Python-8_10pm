0,"22 October, 2023 ","UK: Metropolitan Police defends open calls for Jihad in Central London, says it was said in a different context","It must be mentioned that while Jihad means 'struggle' or 'fight' in Arabic, it implies spreading Islam through violent conquest in the religious context.Amidst the ongoing war between Hamas and the State of Israel, the Metropolitan Police in the United Kingdom downplayed open calls for jihad raised by Hamas supporters in Central London.An X (formerly Twitter) user shared a video wherein members of a radical Islamist outfit named ‘Hizb ut-Tahrir’ were seen proclaiming ‘jihad’ against the State of Israel.“What is the solution to liberate people from the concentration camp called Palestine?” an Islamist was heard saying in the viral video. The mob of Hamas supporters cheered in unison, “Jihad, Jihad, Jihad.”""What is the solution to liberate people from the concentration camp called Palestine?""""Jihad! Jihad! Jihad!""From the Hizb ut Tahrir demonstration pic.twitter.com/Ba5CfkiOsyInstead of taking cognisance of the matter, the UK’s Metropolitan Police came out in defence of the Islamists and said that calls for jihad against Israel had nothing to do with terrorism. In a contentious tweet, it said, “The word jihad has a number of meanings but we know the public will most commonly associate it with terrorism. We have specialist counter-terrorism officers here in the operations room who have particular knowledge in this area.”“They have assessed this video, filmed at the Hizb ut-Tahrir protest in central London today, and have not identified any offences arising from the specific clip,” the police downplayed the act of Hamas supporters.The word jihad has a number of meanings but we know the public will most commonly associate it with terrorism. We have specialist counter terrorism officers here in the operations room who have particular knowledge in this area.They have assessed this video, filmed at the Hizb…“However, recognising the way language like this will be interpreted by the public and the divisive impact it will have, officers have identified the man involved and will be speaking to him shorty to discourage any repeat of similar chanting,” it added.It must be mentioned that while Jihad means ‘struggle’ or ‘fight’ in Arabic, it implies spreading Islam through violent conquest in the religious context.The Metropolitan police also attempted to give a clean chit to an Islamist, who was seen waving a jihadist flag in support of Hamas terrorists. It alleged, “The flags in this photo are not those of ISIS. They are the ‘shahada’ which is a declaration of faith in Islam.” The flags in this photo are not those of ISIS. They are the ‘shahada’ which is a declaration of faith in Islam. ISIS flags may appear similar but are not the same. We have specialist officers with knowledge of flags working on this operation to assist with these assessments.“ISIS flags may appear similar but are not the same. We have specialist officers with knowledge of flags working on this operation to assist with these assessments,” the cops claimed. It must be mentioned that the X user did not make any mention of ISIS and had merely pointed out about the vicious Islamist sloganeering.The Metropolitan police went out of their way to claim that the flag raised at the pro-Hamas rally was not dangerous and that it did not belong to ISIS. Netizens were forced to add community notes to the response of the cops, which negated their attempt to downplay the waving of a jihadist flag.“While the flag is not an ISIS flag, it is known as the jihadist flag used by Al-Qaeda and associated with holy war and a caliphate. In addition, the filmed person explicitly screams “Islamic State”, “Allah curse the Jews”, and “Allah curse the disbelievers” in Arabic,” the community notes read.Just like the Uk’s Metropolitan Police, the Leicester police has been at the forefront of a misinformation campaign that endangered the lives of Hindus in the city, following the Asia Cup group stage match between India and Pakistan on August 28, 2022.In a letter to the Leicester Council of Faiths on August 31 last year, Chief Inspector Paul Allen falsely claimed that a small group of people called for the death of Muslims and Pakistan. He alleged that the provocative slogans were raised in Hindi, indicating that it must have been the handiwork of the Indian Hindu diaspora. “Unfortunately, a small minority of people began chanting in a racially offensive way, calling for (we believe) “death to Pakistan” and “Death to Muslims” In Hindi,” he had claimed initially.His email, the transcript of which has now gone viral on social media, was in reference to a minor scuffle that took place in Belgrave Road of Leicester. The grave assertion made by police chief Paul Allen gave a free licence to Islamists to unleash havoc on the Hindu community.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

1,"21 October, 2023 ","‘No comments, have nothing to say’: Trinamool Congress maintains distance from ‘cash for query’ allegations against party MP Mahua Moitra","""No comments on this particular issue. We have nothing to say on this issue. All India Trinamool Congress will not say a single word,"" said TMC State General Secretary Kunal GhoshAs Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra’s ‘cash for query’ scam gets exposed more and more every day, her party has maintained a distance from the scandal. On 21st October (Saturday), the TMC declined to comment on the alleged scam involving of its Lok Sabha MP Mahua Moitra. Speaking to ANI, TMC State General Secretary Kunal Ghosh asserted that the party has nothing to say on the allegations levelled against Moitra. Speaking on behalf of the party, he maintained silence on the particular issue. Ghosh said, “..No comments on this particular issue. We have nothing to say on this issue. Regarding this issue, the All India Trinamool Congress will not say a single word. The related person may answer this, not the TMC party.”#WATCH | West Bengal | Allegations of bribery against TMC MP Mahua Moitra: TMC State General Secretary Kunal Ghosh says, ""…No comments…Regarding this issue, the TMC will not say anything… The related person may answer this, not the TMC party…"" pic.twitter.com/uIqFZSeDE1Similarly, another senior TMC leader, on the condition of anonymity, told PTI that Trinamool Congress is unwilling to get into a controversy and thus “will be maintaining distance from it.” However, the TMC has not taken action against her or sacked her from the party either. Another vocal face of the TMC, Derek O’Brein, who has been active on social media and defends even fake news peddlers like party MP Saket Gokhale, has also maintained an eerie silence on this issue. Rather he has been speaking actively on the queer issues. It is important to note that in the past several years, Moitra had been the vocal face of TMC on the national stage but the party has maintained distance from her ever since the cash-for-query allegations were levelled against the TMC leader.Following the development, BJP leader Rahul Sinha asserted that the TMC can’t shrug off its responsibility by distancing itself from Mahua Moitra. He said, “The TMC always tries to shrug off its responsibility whenever its leaders are either arrested or land into trouble. The TMC needs to explain whether it supports Mahua Moitra or not.” Meanwhile, TMC Lok Sabha MP from Krishnanagar, Mahua Moitra has been actively tweeting over the issue claiming innocence in the Mahuagate. In a series of tweets on 21st October, she expressed her frustration over the current allegations against her and made various claims in this regard.However, she didn’t deny taking luxury gifts in exchange for asking questions in Lok Sabha, and also didn’t deny that billionaire businessman Darshan Hiranandani was using her Parliamentary portal account to post questions targeting Adani directly. Instead, she argued that every parliamentarian shares login IDs and passwords with staff, interns and others, asking the National Informatics Centre to disclose the details of the places from where the IDs of all the Members of Parliament were accessed.It is notable that BJP MP Nishikant Dubey said in an X post that Mahua Moitra’s NIC ID was being accessed from Dubai. In an affidavit filed with the Parliamentary Ethics Committee, Hiranandani Group CEO Darshan Hiranandani acknowledged that the TMC MP provided him with her Parliamentary login credentials which he used to ask questions from the central government on her behalf. Darshan Hiranandani is based in Dubai, and his affidavit was also signed in Dubai and was notarised by the Consulate General of India in Dubai. He also said that he had given luxury gifts and other favours to Mahua Moitra.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

He also pointed out that Reddy’s arrest underscores the importance of ""safeguarding dissent in a democracy"".On 21st October (Saturday), the Tambram Police in Tamil Nadu arrested BJP leader Amar Prasad Reddy who is also the co-convenor of En Mann En Makkal yatra (My Land, My People). The leader was arrested for opposing the removal of a flagpole outside Annamalai’s residence.As per the Tamil Nadu BJP vice president Narayanan Thirupathy, the BJP leaders were brutally assaulted outside Annamalai’s residence in Chennai.“There are thousands of flagpoles in the city. Are all of them with permission? No, but in this case, we have been seeking permission for the last four months. Why it was not given? And what is the necessity for the police to go there in mass and take that (flag pole) out in the wee hours? What is the need? The time and energy of the police force has been wasted,” Thirupathy said.In past 24 hours -Late night attack at @annamalai_k's residence-BJP leaders were brutally beaten-Co-incharge of Annamalai's Padyatra Amar Reddy is arrestedThis is how DMK govt treats the opposition.But democracy is working fine because they're not Chinese/Pakistani agents. pic.twitter.com/yD2xyQvm5E“Our BJP cadres have been brutally attacked and arrested. More than hundreds of BJP cadres including a lot of women have been detained. What makes you do that? This is vendetta politics. You want to threaten BJP workers, which is not possible,” he further added.It is alleged that he tried to stop government officials from performing their duty and ‘damaged’ a JCB machine that was brought to remove an illegal flag pole in Chennai.As per media reports, it is claimed that a flag pole was installed outside Tamil Nadu BJP chief K Annamalai’s Chennai residence without taking proper permission. But when officials and workers arrived at the spot to remove the flag pole, around 110 BJP workers staged a protest against it. A police official said, “Despite repeated requests, they kept arguing with government officials. Subsequently, some of them were arrested and let off on bail.”The Tambram Police said that no permission was taken from the Greater Chennai Corporation before the installation of a 45-ft flag pole outside the compound wall of Annamalai’s house on Friday evening.According to the police, the flag pole was dangerously close to high-voltage power lines and was causing inconvenience to the public. They added that the corporation and the police later took the decision to remove the flagpole.As per the police officials, apart from Reddy’s arrest, they have also registered a police case against six persons. Five of them have been remanded to judicial custody. Amar Prasad Reddy who also holds the post of state president of Tamil Nadu BJP’s sports and skill development wing, was among those arrested.Following his arrest, BJP leader Kapil Mishra took to X to condemn the arrest and advocated for his release. He also pointed out that Reddy’s arrest underscores the importance of “safeguarding dissent in a democracy”.The arrest of @amarprasadreddy, State President, Sports, and Skill Development Cell, @BJP4TamilNadu, by the TN Government is a stark reminder of the importance of safeguarding dissent in a democracy.

It is to free Tamil Nadu from family dynastic politics, and corruption, and to improve the law & order situation in the state. It is a Yatra to end corruption & start development work.”He added, “I want to tell the Congress party and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Stalin that changing the name does nothing. As soon as you go in public, people remember the commonwealth scam, 2G scam, coal scam, choppers scam, submarine scam, ISRO scam and many more…”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

3,"21 October, 2023 ","‘Hamas is not a terror outfit, they are fighting for Muslims’: SP leader Sumaiya Rana justifies Hamas terror attacks against Israel","While speaking to News18, Rana claimed that Hamas is not a terrorist group, rather they are fighting to protect Al-Aqsa Mosque. She asserted that there is a conspiracy against Muslims and Islam in calling Hamas a terror organisation.On Friday (20th October), the national spokesperson of Samajwadi Party and poet Munawar Rana’s daughter Sumaiya Rana justified Palestinian terrorist group Hamas’s attacks on Israel which resulted in the death of over 1300 civilians. While speaking to News18, Rana claimed that Hamas is not a terrorist group, rather they are fighting to protect Al-Aqsa Mosque. She asserted that there is a conspiracy against Muslims and Islam in calling Hamas a terror organisation.“Everyone can see Hamas’s attack on Israel but no one is noticing the internal damage inflicted on Palestine,” Sumaiya Rana said while justifying Hamas’s onslaught. She added that lakhs of Palestinians have been killed over the last ten years by Israel.#HamasTerrorists did nothing wrong by kiIIing innocent Israelis, they should have done more damage – SP leader Sumaiya Rana (daughter of IsIamist Shayar Munnavar Rana)This is how IsIamists across the world think… They don't even shy away from defending terrorism. pic.twitter.com/SX3yRpgLNPShe further expressed her apprehension that the Israel-Hamas war may transition into a third-world war since several countries are getting involved in it.When asked about Hamas’s decision to attack innocent Israeli civilians, Sumaiya Rana asserted that Hamas’s attacks on Israeli people are due to the ongoing conflict pertaining to the land as well as ‘atrocities’ on Palestinians over the last decade. The Samajwadi Party leader went on to say that Hamas’s ‘reaction’ “is still not up to the level” and that Hamas will not back off.“They [Hamas terrorists] have understood that they have been given this life only to defend Al-Aqsa mosque and that is why they have dedicated their lives for this only,” Rana said.She further demonised the Israeli people labelling them as the most “cruel” community. The Hamas sympathiser went on to claim that Palestine is paying the price of giving refuge to the Jews. Sumaiya Rana added that the animosity between Jews and Muslims has been ongoing since the times of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.“They [Israelis] are inflicting atrocities on the followers of Islam and this conflict will never be resolved with dialogue. It will be resolved only when one of the sides dominates the other,” Rana asserted.She further pushed Hamas’s narrative that Israel had attacked the Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza which allegedly killed over 500 people. This comes even as multiple evidence suggest that Israel was not behind the attack.Despite being repeatedly questioned about Hamas’s killing of innocent Israelis in a brutal attack launched on 7th October, Rana downplayed Hamas’s offensive claiming that Israel has already been attacking Palestine.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

4,"21 October, 2023 ","Kerala: Garment company in Kannur says it will not take fresh orders for uniforms of Israel Police, repeats Hamas lies on Gaza hospital bombing","The Maryan Apparel Pvt Limited's Thomas Olickal stated the company has decided not to accept any fresh orders from the Israel police force until the conflict in Gaza is resolved, accusing Israel of bombing hospitals in GazaA Kerala-based clothing firm that provides the Israeli police with uniforms has announced it would not take orders from Israel until peace is restored. This decision of the apparel company came amid the ongoing Israeli military operations against Hamas in Gaza in retaliation to the horrific terror attack by Hamas on Israel on 7 October. The owner of the business has cited moral grounds for his decision, accusing Israel of atrocities on Palestinians in Gaza. This company is situated in Kannur district of Kerala.The Maryan Apparel Pvt Limited’s Thomas Olickal stated the company has decided not to accept any fresh orders from the Israel police force until the conflict in Gaza is resolved. The classy light blue uniform shirts for the Israel police force are produced by Maryan Apparel Pvt Limited in Kerala’s Kannur district.Thomas Olickal said, “We have been making uniforms for the Israeli police since 2015. The Hamas attack, killing civilians cannot be accepted. Similarly, the revenge by Israel also cannot be accepted. Denying food and water to over 25 lakh people, bombing hospitals, killing innocent women and children and all cannot be accepted at all. We want the war to end and the peace to prevail.”It is notable that now it has been proven that it was a failed rocket fired into Israel from Gaza that fell on a Gaza hospital, but the owner of the garment company is still blaming Israel for the same. Initially, Hamas had claimed that the hospital was hit by an Israeli air strike and over 500 people died. But later it was found that a rocket fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad had failed and hit the parking lot of the hospital, and the actual number of casualties was much less.Thomas Olickal added, “We request everyone to stop the war. The Israel force will not be short of uniforms because of our decision. But this is a moral decision. The bombing of the hospitals cannot be accepted. We have decided not to take further orders temporarily.”He further stated that his company will respect current contracts by international agreements, but will not accept new orders until the conflict is over. He said, “In a year we make up to one lakh shirts for Israeli policemen. We also make shirts and jackets for the Israeli Jail Police. About 30,000 to 50,000 shirts and jackets are sent for the jail police in a year.” He also said that last week after the war broke out, the company was informed by Israel that an extra supply of uniforms would be needed.Maryan Apparel Pvt Limited, which was founded in 2006 in the Kerala state-run Kinfra Park here, specialises in the uniforms of army troops, police officials, security officers, and health care professionals from all over the world. It also provides school uniforms, supermarket employee outfits, physicians’ jackets, coveralls, business attire, and other items.On 7th October, Hamas terrorists entered Israel using motor gliders, boats, and trucks, targeting civilians and Israeli soldiers. Since then, Hamas has taken over 300 people hostage. In response, Israel has launched counterattacks on the Islamic terrorists, vowing to dismantle their infrastructure.Amidst the ongoing violence, reports of a devastating explosion at the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in the Gaza Strip emerged. Palestinians and several Arab countries, including Jordan, Turkey, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, were quick to point fingers at Israel, accusing them of deliberately targeting the medical facility. The Kerala-based company has also cited the attack on the hospital as the reason to break the clothing supply chain of Israeli forces. Media houses like Al Jazeera, the Iranian channel Press TV, and the likes of Alt News co-founder Mohammed Zubair ran propaganda being pushed by Hamas, claiming it was an Israeli rocket. Later, multiple proofs appeared making it clear that Israel did not attack the hospital. It was revealed that the rocket that fell on the hospital was not shot by Israel but by an Iran-backed terrorist organisation, Islamic Jihad, that operates from Gaza.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

5,"20 October, 2023 ","Amid the India-Canada standoff, India has, under the leadership of PM Modi, made it clear that we are no more a pushover nation","Besides India's stern approach towards Canada, it's neutral stance over the Russia-Ukraine war and India's strong retaliation to China's Galwan misadventure, that has strongly signalled to the world that the days of India caving in to pressure from world powers are long gone by. On Friday, October 20, Canada withdrew 41 diplomats and their families from India. The move came after India gave an ultimatum for revoking the diplomatic immunity of those diplomats who stayed back post-10th of October even after being told to leave.Diplomatic ties between India and Canada nose-dived after Canada prematurely expelled an Indian diplomat on the 19th of September following baseless allegations by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of the involvement of Indian agents in the murder of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. India went on to promptly expel a Canadian diplomat in a tit-for-tat response to Ottawa’s expulsion of an Indian official over the case. New Delhi also suspended visa services for Canadian nationals.The chill in relations between the two countries was even evident at the G20 Leaders’ Summit in New Delhi on September 9 and 10, so much so that even local Canadian media chastised its Prime Minister for being overlooked by Indian and other foreign leaders during the G20 Summit.As the bilateral relations between Canada and India worsen, several reports suggest that Canada has been desperately trying to diffuse the diplomatic row with India. India, on its part, has made it clear that it is no longer a pushover nation and would not tolerate acts of aggression, hate, and intimidation from the rest of the world. The Western big powers like the US, Russia and the UK have also when it came to the India-Canada standoff, chosen to steer clear of strongly-worded public statements that would antagonise India, fearing diplomatic backlash from one of the fastest-growing countries in the world and regarded as a potential counterweight to an increasingly assertive China. This is why, when the Canadian Prime Minister sought the support of many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, to raise the issue with India he was snubbed by everyone fearing diplomatic backlash from India.The USA, which has a habit of interfering in every nation’s domestic affairs, was also compelled to toe a fine diplomatic line when it came to the India-Canada standoff. While avoiding offending Canada, one of its closest allies, it did not dare to oppose India. This is primarily because, India, in recent years, has advanced to a position where it is seen as a crucial defence partner for the United States and an essential counterweight to China.The West, including Canada, also has other major things to consider when it comes to India, including strong defence and trade ties that both sides would rather see maintained and strengthened.Another major reason why the Western nations haven’t taken sides may be that they are aware that India’s demand for parity in mutual diplomatic presence does not violate any international rules. In fact, when Canada accused India of flouting the Vienna Convention in withdrawing diplomatic immunity from 41 Canadian diplomats, India strongly responded to Canada’s statement on the withdrawal of some of its diplomats following India’s prod and said no international norm was violated seeking parity in the mutual diplomatic presence in New Delhi and Ottawa. Basically, the Canadian presence in India is much more than India’s presence in Canada. Therefore, India has asked Canada to take back the excess diplomats so that it is equal to Indian diplomats in Canada.Moreover, the West is also completely aware that India is well aware that it has the upper hand and that, if it chooses, it can turn the faucet off and hurt Canada where it hurts the most.The majority of overseas students studying in Canada are from India. According to statistics provided by the Canadian government, around 40% of the 8 lakh international students studying in Canada at the moment are from India. Indian students pay three to five times more in tuition than Canadians do at private colleges. In a sense, Indians support the entire Canadian private college ecosystem, which will disintegrate if the Indian government decides to stop the outflow. Moreover, as many as 600 Canadian companies, including Bombardier and SNC Lavalin, have a strong presence in India, while more than 30 Indian companies, such as infotech majors TCS, Infosys and Wipro have invested billions of dollars in Canada, creating thousands of jobs.The above multiple reasons might have also compelled Canada to change its rhetorics. On Tuesday, October 17, Trudeau and Foreign Minister Melanie Joly indicated that they did not want to fuel tensions with India by speaking about them publicly — a sharp contrast with the open claims against India that the prime minister made in parliament.It is, however, not just in reference to how India has been handling the India-Canada standoff but there are other recent bold decisions India has taken under the leadership of PM Modi like maintaining a neutral stance over the Russia-Ukraine war and India’s strong retaliation to China’s Galwan misadventure, that has strongly signalled to the world that India has a mind of its own and that the days of India caving in to pressure from world powers are long gone by.When Modi initially took office as Prime Minister in May 2014, nobody anticipated this three-time Chief Minister of Gujarat and outsider to Lutyens’ Delhi would become the nation’s top diplomat and steer foreign affairs like a gifted artist. But like in other areas, PM Modi took the initiative and crafted a new multi-dimensional foreign policy of multiple allegiances and issue-based allegiances, which has elevated India to the position of most sought-after partner on the international stage. After all, who could hug two arch-rivals- US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin with the same panache?It is difficult to think of another world leader who could tell Putin directly that this is “not the age of war,” and also persuade his foreign minister S Jaishankar to tell the arrogant West that “Europe’s problems are not the world’s problems,” while yet managing to maintain good relations with both sides.The West actually fought tooth and nail to have us on their side during the Russia-Ukraine war. India was under intense pressure from the United States to adopt a position. Despite the pressure, India resisted giving in. India remained impartial in regard to the situation between Russia and Ukraine despite pressure from the West.India’s toughness in its attitude was warmly received by the West, which was demonstrated by the fact that despite their differences, the U.S. and India have continued to have a strong collaboration in areas such as business, technology, security, and education.In June 2020, Indian and Chinese troops clashed in the Galwan Valley. The clash was the worst fighting in over four decades and resulted in severe casualties on both sides. The deaths of 20 Indian soldiers was the first time Indian Army personnel were killed on the Line of Actual Control since October 1975.China, still celebrating its victory in 1962, blatantly misjudged India’s resolve to oppose its land-grabbing strategies this time. Beijing was shocked when the Modi administration chose to protect India’s frontiers.At first, India and China had multiple rounds of discussions, both officially in Delhi and Beijing and at the level of military commanders on the LAC. However, when it became clear that China would not back down, India made the decision to establish trade limitations on Chinese investors and goods.The Indian government, led by Prime Minister Modi, authorized the Indian Army to respond to any further escalation on the front lines in a responsible manner. An example of this was the aggressive occupation of specific heights by Indian troops near the Pangong Tso on August 5, 2020, which caught China off guard.With its handling of China’s Galwan misadventure, India once again demonstrated to the world that it is no longer a nation to be taken lightly.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

6,"19 October, 2023 ",Theory of ‘Basic Structure’ and its impact on NJAC: Why a synthesized NJAC would be better than the Collegium system,"The National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act was passed in 2014 with the aim of introducing a new mechanism for appointments. However, in 2015, the Supreme Court struck down the NJAC Act, asserting that it violated the basic structure of the Constitution and upheld the primacy of the collegium system.The Constitution remains a living document that reflects the will of the people as expressed through its founding principles and values. The Constitution of India is made up of several key components that include the Preamble, Part III & Part IV of the Constitution of India. Additionally, it includes fundamental principles like democracy, secularism, socialism, and sovereignty, which guide the functioning of the Indian state. The Constitution establishes a federal parliamentary structure backed by three concrete independent yet assimilated and synergized pillars of powers separated out as the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.DISTRIBUTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL & LEGAL POWERSThe Constitution ensures the separation of powers by defining the roles, functions, and limitations of each branch. Additionally, it includes mechanisms to prevent one branch from unduly encroaching upon the powers of another. The specific allocation of powers in the Indian Constitution is a crucial feature that evolved to concretize a balance of power amongst all three domains and simultaneously ensure that one power constituent does not infringe upon the other’s sphere. The separation of powers is a fundamental feature of our Constitution that ensures the allocation of roles, responsibilities and powers to three distinct branches with inbuilt checks and balances.EXECUTIVE BRANCHThe executive branch consists of two separate sub-branches; one is administrative & the other is political executive. The administrative branch is committed to implementing and enforcing rules and regulations and protects the sanctity of the law of the land. The Political executive is represented by the President of India, the Vice President, and the Council of Ministers (headed by the Prime Minister). The executive branch is expected to run the day-to-day affairs of the government, making policy decisions, and implementing laws passed by the Legislature.LEGISLATIVE BRANCHThe legislative branch is primarily responsible for formulating laws. The legislative power is demonstrated by two houses – the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. The Parliament of India has the power to make, amend, and repeal laws on various subjects listed in the Constitution.JUDICIAL BRANCHThe judiciary is owed with responsibility to dispense justice & also interpret the laws. It is independent of the other two branches.ARTICLE 13Article 13 primarily focuses on safeguarding fundamental rights. It states that any law whether pre- or post-Constitution which is found in conflict with or at variance with fundamental rights shall be revoked to the extent of variance. It empowers the judiciary to review laws and, if necessary, strike them down if they violate fundamental rights. Article 13 provides a protective umbrella to maintain the inviolability of fundamental rights due to any legislative or executive action. The term “law” in Article 13 includes not only statutes and legislation passed by Parliament or State Legislatures but also ordinances, regulations, orders, bylaws, rules, and other forms of delegated or subordinate legislation. Article 13(2) empowers the judiciary, especially the Supreme Court and High Courts to review the constitutionality of laws where if any law is assessed to be in violation of fundamental rights and inherent spirits, the same can be suitably declared void to the extent of inconsistency. The Court held that an amendment under Article 368 is “law” within the meaning of Article 13 of the Constitution and therefore, if an amendment “takes away or abridges” a Fundamental Right conferred by Part III, it is void. In essence, Article 13 serves as a safeguard for the fundamental rights of Indian citizens and ensures that any existing law or new legislation that violates these rights can be declared void by the judiciary, upholding the supremacy of the Constitution. Article 13 is a critical tool in ensuring that fundamental rights are not violated or undermined by any legislative or executive action. It provides a mechanism for citizens to challenge laws that infringe upon their fundamental rights in the courts.ARTICLE 368Article 368 of the Constitution of India deals with the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution. It outlines the procedures and mechanisms for amending various parts of the Indian Constitution. It grants Parliament the power to amend various provisions of the Constitution. Article 368 confers upon the Parliament of India the power to amend the Constitution. It can amend any provision of the Constitution including the provisions related to the fundamental rights of citizens. Amendments can be made by introducing a bill in either house of Parliament (Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha). Some amendments can be passed by a simple majority of the members present and voting in each house. Certain other amendments, which are not related to the federal structure but still affect significant parts of the Constitution, require a special majority. This means they must be passed by most of the total membership of each house and by a two-thirds majority of the members present and voting. Article 368 itself contains an exception. It specifies that certain provisions of the Constitution, such as the federal structure, Parliamentary form of government etc. cannot be amended without the ratification of most state legislatures. Article 368 is crucial in understanding the process by which the Indian Constitution can be amended. The theory of Basic Structure impinges upon the ambit of amendment to any provisions of the Constitution of India.THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ARTICLE 13 AND ARTICLE 368 CAN BE UNDERSTOOD AS FOLLOWSArticle 13 acts as a watchdog on the power of Parliament as provided under Article 368. It ensures that while Parliament has the authority to amend the Constitution, it cannot do so in a manner that violates fundamental rights. Article 13 does not make all constitutional amendments invalid. Instead, it applies specifically to amendments that violate fundamental rights. If a constitutional amendment infringes upon fundamental rights, it can be declared void to that extent, as per Article 13. The doctrine of Basic structure limits the amending power of Parliament, is a product of judicial interpretation and was established in the Keshvanand Bharati case (1973). It harmonizes the powers of Article 13 and Article 368 by allowing amendments that do not affect the basic structure of the Constitution and ensuring that fundamental rights are protected. While Article 13 and Article 368 have different purposes, they work together to maintain a balance between amending the Constitution and protecting fundamental rights. The basic structure doctrine which is a judicially evolved concept in the epoch-making Keshwa NandThe Bharti case is a key element that reconciles by setting limits on the amendment power to prevent any alteration of the core principles of the Constitution. The Basic Structure is however not defined & is left to the interpretation of Justices of the bench, every time it gets constituted.OVERSTEPPING OF ORGANSLegislature Overstepping:The legislature may sometimes pass laws that are in violation of the Constitution. In such cases, the judiciary has the authority to strike down these laws through judicial review.Executive  Overstepping:The executive can issue ordinances in exceptional circumstances when Parliament is not in session. However, if the legislature excessively uses ordinances to bypass the normal legislative process, it can be seen as overstepping its authority. The President, on the advice of the Cabinet, can declare a state of emergency under specific circumstances. However, if the executive misuses emergency powers for political gain or to suppress dissent, it can be seen as overstepping its authority.Judiciary  Overstepping:While the judiciary’s role includes interpreting the Constitution and protecting fundamental rights, excessive judicial activism, where the judiciary takes on roles that are traditionally the domain of the executive or legislature, can be seen as overstepping. It’s important to note that the allocation of powers in the Indian Constitution is designed to create a delicate balance and each branch has specific checks and balances on the others to prevent overstepping. Additionally, the concept of judicial review allows the judiciary to strike down laws and actions that violate the Constitution, serving as a vital safeguard against overreach by the legislature and executive. In practice, maintaining this balance is an ongoing challenge, and instances of overstepping can arise. However, the system relies on the vigilance of each branch, as well as public awareness and engagement, to ensure that the principles of democracy and the rule of law are upheld. In any democratic system, including India, there is always the potential for one branch of government to overstep its authority, which can lead to a disruption of the system of checks and balances. Here are some common examples of overstepping of authority by the three branches of government in India: where the judiciary is perceived to have overstepped its boundaries into the legislative and executive domains in India, has been a subject of debate. While the judiciary’s role includes interpreting the Constitution and ensuring the protection of fundamental rights, there have been instances where it has made decisions that some critics argue encroach upon the functions of the other branches of government. The term “judicial activism” is often used to describe instances where the judiciary takes an active role in shaping public policy and governance. Critics argue that at times, judicial activism has led to the judiciary overstepping its role. For instance, in the case of Vishakha v. State of Rajasthan, the Supreme Court formulated guidelines on workplace sexual harassment even before specific legislation was enacted. While this was seen as a necessary step to protect women’s rights, it raised questions about whether the judiciary was intruding into legislative territory. The judiciary has been actively involved in environmental matters, issuing directives and guidelines to address issues like air pollution, river cleaning, and industrial pollution. While this has been necessary to protect the environment and public health, critics argue that such interventions sometimes bypass the executive’s role in crafting and implementing environmental policies. made by the executive. The judiciary has been involved in decisions related to religious practices. The Sabarimala temple entry case, where the Supreme Court allowed women of all ages to enter the temple, raised questions about whether the judiciary was infringing on religious traditions and practices, a domain traditionally left to religious authorities. The judiciary has been involved in issues related to reservation policies. In some cases, it has ordered changes in reservation criteria or questioned the implementation of reservation policies, which are primarily within the legislative domain. It’s essential to recognize that these instances of perceived judicial overreach often come with differing interpretations and perspectives. Some view them as necessary interventions to protect fundamental rights and uphold the rule of law, while others argue that they encroach on the legislative and executive functions. To address concerns about judicial overreach, there have been calls for greater clarity in the separation of powers, the need for well-defined roles and responsibilities of each branch of government, and discussions on judicial reform to ensure that the judiciary respects the boundaries set by the Constitution while upholding the rights and welfare of citizens. While the judiciary’s role includes interpreting the Constitution and protecting fundamental rights, and excessive judicial activism, the judiciary takes on roles that are traditionally the domain of the executive or legislature, which can be seen as overstepping.While judicial review is a crucial aspect of the separation of powers, an overly broad interpretation of this power can lead to a perception that the judiciary is encroaching on the legislative and executive domains. It’s important to note that the separation of powers in the Indian Constitution is designed to create a delicate balance and each branch has specific checks and balances on the others to prevent overstepping. Additionally, the concept of judicial review allows the judiciary to strike down laws and actions that violate the Constitution, serving as a vital safeguard against overreach by the legislature and executive. In practice, maintaining this balance is an ongoing challenge, and instances of overstepping can arise. However, the system relies on the vigilance of each branch, as well as public awareness and engagement, to ensure that the principles of democracy and the rule of law are upheld.KESHVANAND BHARTI CASEIn the Keshvanand Bharati case, relief was sought against the Kerala government vis-à-vis two state land reform laws, which imposed restrictions on the management of religious property. Question underlying the case: Was the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution unlimited? In other words, could Parliament alter, amend, or abrogate any part of the Constitution even to the extent of taking away all fundamental rights? The Constitutional Bench in the Keshvanand Bharati case ruled by a 7-6 verdict that Parliament could amend any part of the Constitution so long as it did not alter or amend the basic structure or essential features of the Constitution. However, the court did not define the term ‘basic structure’, and only listed a few principles — federalism, secularism, democracy — as being its part. The ‘basic  structure doctrine has since been interpreted to include:BASIC STRUCTUREThe basic structure doctrine was established in Keshvanand Bharati v. State of Kerala in 1973. In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, however, cannot do so in a manner that violates or alters its basic structure. This doctrine is significant because it places limitations on the amending power of the Indian Parliament, ensuring that the core principles and values of the Constitution remain intact and unaltered. It was developed to determine the limits of the amending power of Parliament (under Article 368) and to protect certain core principles and values of the Constitution. The power of judicial review, which empowers the judiciary to measure the constitutionality of laws and actions including constitutional amendments, is a vital part of the doctrine of Basic Structure. The primary aim of the basic structure doctrine is to ensure that the fundamental principles and essential features of the Constitution, which are vital for maintaining democracy, justice, equality, and the rule of law, are not arbitrarily or substantially altered through constitutional amendments. The basic structure doctrine is a legal principle developed by the Indian judiciary, particularly by the Supreme Court of India.CHANGE INEVITABLEThe architects of the Indian Constitution granted confirmed powers to Parliament as per the needs and demands of “We the People”. Article 368, which gives Parliament the power to amend the Constitution, can also be amended. The Constitution is an ever-developing index & a reflection of the collective consciousness of the citizens which embodies the spirit of the nation. The dynamism in the Constitution is integral, however, the Doctrine of Basic Structure impedes the dynamism. The impact of the past enriches it now and makes the future richer than the present.” A provision for amending the Constitution has been made to address any challenges “We the People” may face in the future as the Constitution functions since time is not static; it is always changing, just as the political, economic, and social circumstances of the people do.APPOINTMENT OF JUSTICES PRIOR TO 1993Before the introduction of the collegium system in 1993, the appointment of judges to the higher Courts in India, including the Supreme Court and High Courts, was primarily made under the provisions of Article 124 and Article 217 of the Indian Constitution. The Chief Justice of India, as the head of the judiciary, would recommend the names of candidates for appointment as judges to the President. These recommendations were often made after consultation with other senior judges, both within the Supreme Court and the concerned High Court. The President of India, bound by the advice of the Council of Ministers (the executive branch), would make the final appointments based on the recommendations received from the Chief Justice and the Executive. The executive branch played a significant role in the appointment process. The President would consider the recommendations and could seek further information or clarification if necessary. In practice, the government had a significant say in the appointment process. While the Chief Justice’s recommendations were considered, the government’s role in the final decision often led to allegations of political influence in judicial appointments. The introduction of the collegium system in 1993 marked a significant shift in the appointment process. Under the collegium system, a group of senior judges of the Supreme Court, including the Chief Justice of India, became responsible for recommending candidates for judicial appointments. This system was cited as aimed at enhancing the independence of the judiciary in the appointment process. It means that all appointments of justices up to 1993 were incorrect and subject to legislative and executive interference. It is assumed that the frailties of the appointment of justice were over with the introduction of a collegium system with necessary transparency and accountability. The question of whether all judicial appointments made before the introduction of the collegium system in 1993 were “incorrect” or subject to legislative and executive interference is a matter of perspective and legal interpretation. The introduction of the collegium system was aimed at addressing certain perceived shortcomings in the earlier appointment process and enhancing the independence of the judiciary, but it does not inherently render all prior appointments “incorrect.”ADVENT OF COLLEGIUMThe collegium system was introduced through a series of judicial pronouncements and not through a specific legislative enactment. It evolved gradually over several decades. The term “collegium” itself was coined in the 1990s. The idea of judicial consultation in the appointment of judges can be traced back to various judicial precedents. For example, in the 1977 case of S.P. Gupta v. Union of India, commonly known as the “First Judges Case,” the Supreme Court held that the Chief Justice of India (CJI) should consult with a plurality of judges to make recommendations for appointments of Justices. The significant development in the establishment of the collegium system came in the Second Judges Case, also known as the Advocates-on-Record Association v. Union of India (1993). In this case, the Supreme Court held that the CJI should make recommendations to the President in consultation with a collegium of senior judges. The court ruled that the executive’s role should be limited to appointing judges based on these recommendations. Following the Second Judges Case, the collegium system became the standard practice for judicial appointments in India. The system evolved over time, and the composition of the collegium varied, but it generally included the CJI and a group of senior judges of the Supreme Court. Several other cases and judgments in subsequent years further clarified and reaffirmed the collegium system’s role in the appointments and transfers of judges.NJACNational Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC): The issue of judicial appointments faced significant debate and controversy, leading to attempts to change the appointment process. The National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act was passed in 2014 with the aim of introducing a new mechanism for appointments. However, in 2015, the Supreme Court struck down the NJAC Act, asserting that it violated the basic structure of the Constitution and upheld the primacy of the collegium system. NJAC was an attempt to reform the judiciary’s appointment process and may not be seen as legislative overreach per se, the judiciary’s concerns about the potential impact on judicial independence were central to the court’s decision. This complex issue reflects the ongoing debate about the balance between the branches of government and the role of the judiciary in safeguarding the Constitution in India’s democratic system.EXISTING ARRANGEMENTIt is true that the appointment process before the judiciary evolved into the collegium system, allowing involvement and influence from the executive branch, particularly in the final decision-making stage. This sometimes led to allegations of political interference in judicial appointments. While the introduction of the collegium system was a significant step toward enhancing judicial independence in the appointment process, it does not necessarily render all appointments made before 1993 as “incorrect.” The issue of judicial appointments is complex and has evolved over time in response to various challenges and concerns. The collegium system is one of the many mechanisms designed to address these concerns, but it is not without its own set of criticisms and debates. While the judiciary plays a vital role in safeguarding the Constitution, it also has its limitations. It cannot directly enforce its decisions, relying on the executive branch to implement them. Leaving the judiciary as the sole custodian may raise questions about democratic accountability. Judges are not elected representatives, and some argue that their power should be checked by elected officials who are directly accountable to the people. The theory of separation of powers suggests that no single branch of government should have unchecked authority. While the judiciary’s independence is crucial, an appropriate balance of powers among the branches is essential for a well-functioning democracy. The power to amend the Constitution (under Article368) lies with the legislature. If the judiciary was the sole custodian, it could potentially limit the ability of the legislature to make necessary constitutional amendments. In practice, the Indian Constitution is committed to establishing a system of balance among the three branches of government: the executive, the legislature, and the judiciary. While the judiciary plays a significant role in interpreting and upholding the Constitution, it does so within the broader framework of democratic governance.Ambedkar said, “However good the Constitution is, it might turn out not to be good if the people were administering it bad however bad the Constitution is, it might do its job well if people administering it happen to be good.” “Enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm” and “if men were angels, no government would be necessary”, we get to an axiomatic idea of checks and balances.The question of whether the judiciary alone the custodian of the Constitution of India should be is a matter of considerable debate and has been a subject of discussion in legal and political circles.JUDICIARY AS CUSTODIAN OF THE CONSTITUTIONThe judiciary is designed to be an independent branch of government, which is essential for interpreting and upholding the Constitution impartially. Its decisions are not influenced by political considerations.Judges have legal expertise and training, which makes them well-suited to interpreting and applying the Constitution’s provisions and principles accurately.The judiciary serves as a check on the actions of the executive and legislative branches to ensure that they are in conformity with the Constitution. This helps prevent potential abuse of power.The power of judicial review allows the judiciary to strike down laws and actions that violate the Constitution. This is a critical mechanism for protecting individual rights and preserving constitutional values.COUNTERVIEW OF JUDICIARY AS SINGLE CUSTODIAN OF THE CONSTITUTIONWhile the judiciary plays a vital role in safeguarding the Constitution, it also has its limitations. It cannot directly enforce its decisions, relying on the executive branch to implement them.Leaving the judiciary as the sole custodian may raise questions about democratic accountability. Judges are not elected representatives, and some argue that their power should be checked by elected officials who are directly accountable to the people.The separation of powers doctrine suggests that no single branch of government should have unchecked authority. While the judiciary’s independence is crucial, an appropriate balance of powers among the branches is essential for a well-functioning democracy.The power to amend the Constitution (under Article 368) lies with the legislature. If the judiciary were the sole custodian, it could potentially limit the ability of the legislature to make necessary constitutional amendments.The consensus in most democratic systems is that the Constitution should be a shared responsibility, with each branch of government playing a role in its protection and preservation. The exact balance between these branches can vary from one country to another, depending on the specific constitutional framework and historical context.HERE IS HOW THE APPOINTMENT PROCESS WORKED PRIOR TO THE COLLEGIUM SYSTEMBefore the introduction of the collegium system in 1993, the appointment of judges to the higher courts in India, including the Supreme Court and High Courts, was primarily made by the President of India in consultation with the Chief Justice of India. This method was based on Article 124 and Article 217 of the Indian Constitution. The CJI, SC as the head of the judiciary,would recommend the names of candidates for appointment as judges to the President. These recommendations were often made after consultation with other senior justices, both within the Supreme Court and the concerned High Court. President’s Decision: The President of India, acting on the advice of the Council of Ministers (the executive branch), would make the final appointments based on the recommendations received from the Chief Justice and the Executive.The executive branch played a significant role in the appointment process. The President would consider the recommendations and could seek further information or clarification if necessary.In practice, the government had a significant say in the appointment process. While the Chief Justice’s recommendations were taken into account, the government’s role in the final decision often led to allegations of political influence in judicial appointments.The introduction of the collegium system in 1993 affected the process of appointment of judges significantly, tilting the weight towards the judiciary. Under the collegium system, a group of senior judges of the Supreme Court, including the Chief Justice of India, became responsible for recommending candidates for judicial appointments. The system was said to be committed to ushering in the independence of the judiciary. It’s important to note that the collegium system itself has faced criticism and debate, with some arguing that it lacks transparency and accountability. The issue of judicial appointments in India has been the subject of ongoing reform discussions, and various proposals for change have been considered over the years.The question of whether all judicial appointments made before the introduction of the collegium system in 1993 were “incorrect” or subject to legislative and executive interference is a matter of perspective and legal interpretation. The introduction of the collegium system was aimed at addressing certain perceived shortcomings in the earlier appointment process and enhancing the independence of the judiciary, but it does not inherently render all prior appointments “incorrect.”It is true that the appointment process before the collegium system allowed for involvement and influence from the executive branch, particularly in the final decision-making stage. This sometimes led to allegations of political interference in judicial appointments.The introduction of the collegium system was one of several reforms aimed at improving the appointment process and reducing the potential for political interference. However, no system is without its own criticisms and challenges.Appointing judges to the higher courts is a complex and nuanced process. It involves considerations of legal expertise, integrity, experience, and the need to uphold the independence of the judiciary. Different systems and mechanisms have been used to strike the right balance between these considerations.The collegium system did not retroactively invalidate appointments made before its introduction. Judicial decisions made by judges appointed under the previous system remain valid and legally binding.The debate over judicial appointments and reforms in this area continues in India. Various proposals and discussions have taken place regarding potential improvements to the appointment process, including increasing transparency and accountability.In summary, while the introduction of the collegium system was a significant step toward enhancing judicial independence in the appointment process, it does not necessarily render all appointments made before 1993 as “incorrect.” The issue of judicial appointments is complex and has evolved over time in response to various challenges and concerns. The collegium system is one of the many mechanisms designed to address these concerns, but it is not without its own set of criticisms and debates.The collegium system for the appointment and transfer of judges in India was introduced through a series of judicial pronouncements and not through a specific legislative enactment.

The system evolved over time, and the composition of the collegium varied, but it generally included the CJI and a group of senior judges of the Supreme Court. The collegium system, as it stands today, remains the predominant method for appointing and transferring judges in the higher judiciary in India. It is based on judicial interpretations and pronouncements, making it a unique and distinctive feature of India’s legal system.The issue of judicial appointments faced significant debate and controversy, leading to attempts to change the appointment process. The National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act was passed in 2014 with the aim of introducing a new mechanism for appointments. However, in 2015, the Supreme Court struck down the NJAC Act, asserting that it violated the basic structure of the Constitution and upheld the primacy of the collegium system. The very fact that  the NJAC  was  struck  null  &  void is  itself a  violation  of  the  basic  structure  of  theConstitution of India as it is nowhere prevalent that justice chooses justice which may lead to favoritism to family members & friends. In the absence of a strict definition of the Basic Structure of the Constitution, it is well nigh appropriate to deduce that the Judiciary overstepped & violated the Basic Structure & tenets associated with it. The provisions as enshrined in Article 124 and Article 217 of the Indian Constitution were inviolable & power & appointment could not have been concentrated within a fold by one of the organs unilaterally. If that is true, all other constitutional & sensitive appointments may be determined by concerned departments under the same pleas of keeping interference of other organs let it be executive, legislative & judiciary. Judiciary alone cannot be accorded special status as fundamentally deemed non-interfering & neutral pillar out of three pillars. While preserving the independence of the judiciary is a paramount requirement, the NJAC with assimilated & synthesized composition would have offered a better & competent option within the ambit of the Basic Structure.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

7,"17 October, 2023 ",Promotion of Tribal Cultural Heritage and its importance to decolonisation and nation building: How the Modi govt has taken strides in this direction,"The story of Bharat is a story of its indigenous identity and heritage, and by reclaiming the narrative on Bharatiyata with an autochthonous renascence of its tribal components, we can build a truly decolonized discourse for a civilizational resurgence, in our bid to become a Vishwa Guru again.India is home to a diverse array of tribal communities, each with its distinct languages, customs, and traditions, contributing to the rich cultural tapestry of the nation. These indigenous tribes have inhabited India’s forests, hills, and plains for centuries, maintaining a harmonious relationship with nature and embodying a unique way of life. With a deep-rooted connection to their ancestral lands, tribal societies often exhibit close-knit communal structures and practices that have evolved over generations. The tribes of India possess an invaluable repository of traditional knowledge, encompassing everything from herbal medicine and sustainable farming practices to intricate craftsmanship and artistry. Despite modern advancements, preserving the traditions and well-being of India’s tribes remains crucial for maintaining cultural diversity and ensuring the equitable development of the nation. As Padma Vibhushan Dr. M.S. Swaminathan, the main architect of India’s Green Revolution, once said“One of India’s major blessings is the rich store of experience and knowledge available in the rural and tribal areas.”There are some unique indigenous tribal cultural dimensions in India that are not found anywhere else in the world. The Kattunayakan tribe in the Nilgiri Hills of southern India has a unique tradition of honey hunting. They follow ancient rock paintings that depict honey collection methods, utilizing a remarkable symbiotic relationship with local bees to gather honey. The Tangkhul Naga tribe in Manipur celebrates a distinctive festival called Lui-Ngai-Ni, where men demonstrate their strength by pulling huge stone slabs across the village. This ritual reflects their cultural heritage and emphasizes community bonding. The Mishing tribe of Assam practices a unique form of pottery known as Ali Aye Ligang. During this traditional festival, women create intricate clay pots using distinct patterns, symbolizing fertility, prosperity, and the tribe’s cultural identity. The Warli tribe, residing in the Western Ghats of Maharashtra, is renowned for its tribal art characterized by simplistic geometric shapes and patterns. This traditional art form, often used to depict daily life and rituals, has gained global recognition for its distinctive style. As an environmental activist and ecofeminist, Dr. Vandana Shiva once said,“The heartbeat of our land is echoed in the rhythms of Adivasi cultures, enriching our diversity and teaching us the value of unity.”Since coming into power in 2014, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has emphasized the preservation and revitalization of India’s diverse cultural heritage, including the rich traditions of its tribal communities. Through various initiatives and policies, the government has aimed to foster a cultural resurgence that recognizes the importance of tribal identity, traditions, and customs. One of the premier initiatives to celebrate and showcase India’s tribal heritage is the Aadi Mahotsav, started in 2017 by the Union Ministry of Tribal Affairs and the Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India (TRIFED).  It gives indigenous communities the opportunity to showcase tribal products and help artisans connect with the mainstream population at the National Tribal Crafts Expo. In 2023, more than one thousand tribal artisans and artists from 28 states and union territories participated in the festival. The Modi government introduced the Van Dhan Yojana, which focuses on enhancing tribal livelihoods through value addition to forest produce. This policy empowers tribal communities by providing them with training, technology, and market access to develop and market their traditional products, thereby preserving their cultural practices. The government established the Eklavya Model Residential Schools to provide quality education to tribal children while respecting their cultural sensitivities. These schools offer a curriculum that combines mainstream education with the preservation of tribal languages, traditions, and knowledge. The government has actively implemented the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act (PESA), allowing tribal communities greater control over local governance and natural resources. This policy safeguards their cultural heritage by recognizing their authority over land, resources, and decision-making processes. This government also elected to the seat of the President of India Shrimati Draupadi Murmu, who belongs to the Adivasi Santal community, in a move that truly showed that we are on the path towards decolonization and embracing our indigenous heritage and roots with sincerity and integrity. She once famously said,“It is a tribute to the power of our democracy that a daughter born in a poor house in a remote tribal area can reach the highest constitutional position in India. And it is a matter of great satisfaction for me that those who have been deprived for centuries and those who have been denied the benefits of development, those poor, downtrodden, backwards and tribals are seeing their reflection in me. From Santhal revolution, Paika revolution to Kol revolution and Bhil revolution, all these revolutions had strengthened the tribal contribution in the freedom struggle. I am happy that many museums are being built across the country dedicated to the role of the tribal communities in our freedom struggle. I was born in that tribal tradition which has lived in harmony with nature for thousands of years.”With 2023 being observed as the International Year of Millets, the Union government has laid emphasis on the importance of millets in the tribal areas of the country. Millets are often called `Shree Anna’ which means `the honoured grain’ or `the mother of all grains’. Mahatma Gandhi once said: “In the richness of millets, we rediscover ancient wisdom and modern sustenance, a testament to the resilience of traditional crops.” An interesting case of how governmental intervention has helped with the resurgence of consumption of Shree Anna in rural India is the Korku tribe of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, which had a nutritional downslide in the 1970s when they rapidly moved away from millets to soybean and wheat, leading to malnutrition and worsening health conditions. With interventions such as the formation of Farmer Producer Organizations, the establishment of Centers of Excellence and seed hubs for Shree Anna (supported under the National Food Security Mission), tribes like the Korku have slowly started to move back towards their traditional food practices. Tribal millets like Kodo (Paspalum Scrobiculatum), Kutki (little millet) and Sawa (Indian barnyard millet) are seeing the light of day in a big way again. You may ask how food can be a part of the cultural heritage of a people. Well, food habits are a basic part of a culture that also serves as a point of emotional association, a channel of bonding or discrimination, while having symbolic references. Millets have been identified as foxtail millet (Priyangava – प्रियंगव), Barnyard millet (Anaava – अनाव), and black finger millet (Shyaamaka – श्यामक) in some of the oldest Yajurveda writings from India. The Yimchunger Nagas of Nagaland celebrate the Metumniu festival in August after harvesting millet crops. People in Vishakhapatnam’s tribal communities celebrate the Mandukiya festival in June-July each year, where bullocks are fed ragi-based food items. After observing Deepotsav (Diwali) or on the sacred day of Nagula Chavithi, it is customary to have ragi pancakes or other recipes. Madiah (ragi), along with turmeric, is still smeared on the bride and groom’s body during wedding rites in Madhya Pradesh. In tribal societies, millet seeds are believed to provide protection against evil spirits. To ensure successful hunting and a plentiful harvest, the Pahadi Korwa tribe of Chhattisgarh hang millet stalks in their courtyards.Post-Independence, the documentation of tribal practices in India faced challenges stemming from a lack of dedicated efforts, resulting in the loss of invaluable cultural knowledge as traditional practices faded away undocumented. Historical biases and a focus on mainstream narratives often marginalized tribal communities, leading to inadequate representation and documentation of their unique cultural practices, languages, and rituals. The absence of standardized methodologies and insufficient collaboration between academic researchers and tribal communities hindered comprehensive documentation, limiting the preservation and understanding of India’s diverse tribal heritage. What we often forget when observing and documenting tribal cultural practices is that more often than not it is us who have to learn a lot from them, as put forth by Jaipal Singh Munda, a member of the Constituent Assembly, in the context of democracy as a socio-cultural and political thought,“You can’t teach democracy to tribals. You need to learn democratic values from them. They are the most democratic community on earth.”The Modi government initiated a comprehensive documentation effort to record endangered tribal cultural practices, languages, and rituals. This policy aims to create a repository of knowledge that can be preserved, studied, and shared to prevent the loss of valuable traditions. The comprehensive documentation effort initiated by the Modi government involves ethnographic research teams collaborating with tribal communities to meticulously record and document endangered cultural practices, encompassing rituals, ceremonies, linguistic nuances, and traditional ecological knowledge. This initiative employs modern technologies such as audiovisual recording, digital archiving, and geospatial mapping to create an accessible and comprehensive repository, ensuring the preservation of endangered tribal cultural practices for academic study, community reference, and future revival efforts. There is still ongoing debate and discussion on whether utilizing remote sensing technologies such as drones and satellite imagery for non-intrusive documentation of tribal culture in India is a possible approach, given international examples such as from Guyana, where members of the Wapichan tribe use Parrot Bebop quadcopters for documenting preservation of important cultural and sacred sites to monitoring land-use patterns. The documentation effort by the Modi government also encompasses partnerships with anthropologists, linguists, and cultural experts, who work alongside tribal members to ensure accurate representation and culturally sensitive portrayal, safeguarding the integrity of the recorded practices while fostering a deeper understanding of tribal heritage. This work has also been facilitated by the `double engine model’ with state governments in BJP-run states such as in Goa, where the Tribal Research Institute was registered under the Societies Registration Act 1860 in January 2023 for better documentation and showcasing of tribal culture in Goa.Under the aegis of the BJP government’s Tribal Cultural Heritage Revival Program, a targeted funding framework was established, channelling resources directly to tribal communities for the documentation, preservation, and revitalization of their endangered cultural traditions. Through this mechanism, tribal groups are invited to submit comprehensive project proposals, outlining specific cultural practices targeted for revival, proposed methodologies, and anticipated outcomes, thus ensuring a focused and strategic approach. The funding allocation process involves an interdisciplinary review panel comprising cultural experts, anthropologists, linguists, and tribal representatives, who evaluate proposals based on criteria such as cultural significance, potential impact, community engagement, and sustainability. Upon approval, the granted funds are disbursed in phases, contingent on achieving predefined milestones, as outlined in the project proposal. This phased disbursement structure promotes accountability, effective resource utilization, and progress tracking. Even the Tribal Sub-Plan, which came into existence in the 1970s for developing areas with tribal concentration, was functional mainly as an accounting exercise without adequate emphasis on the planning and execution of schemes to ensure demonstrable benefits for the scheduled tribes, for decades! The Tribal Cultural Heritage Revival Program allocated a budget of ₹500 crores during its first phase to support various projects aimed at documenting, preserving, and reviving endangered tribal cultural practices. Under this program, over 2,000 traditional tribal festivals and cultural events have been financially supported and promoted, facilitating the preservation and celebration of indigenous rituals and traditions across different tribal communities. The Tribal Cultural Heritage Revival Program has facilitated the establishment of more than 300 Tribal Heritage Conservation Centers across the country, providing resources, technical expertise, and training to tribal communities for the documentation, archiving, and promotion of their cultural practices, languages, and traditions. In addition to financial support, the BJP government has organized capacity-building workshops, technical training, and access to modern tools such as digitization equipment and archival software, empowering tribal communities to execute their revival initiatives efficiently while integrating modern documentation techniques. On the occasion of the Tiranga Utsav on 2 August 2022, Union Minister of Home Affairs Shri Amit Shah released a pictorial book in memory of revolutionary tribal fighters of the Indian freedom struggle in partnership with Amar Chitra Katha.The Modi government has facilitated cultural exchange programs and workshops that bring together different tribal communities to share and learn from each other’s endangered cultural practices. These interactions contribute to the revitalization and cross-pollination of tribal customs. The Union government facilitated a series of cultural exchange workshops, engaging tribal artists and artisans from various regions, allowing them to share and exchange their unique cultural practices, craftsmanship, and traditional knowledge. This was beautifully encapsulated in the words of Indian playwright Mahesh Elkunchwar“Adivasi heritage is a tapestry woven with threads of resilience, wisdom, and cultural diversity that enrich the fabric of our nation.”It has also promoted the work of the Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan and organised the Tribal Youth Exchange Programme for the development of tribal youth with the support of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. The aim of this programme is to provide an opportunity to the tribal youth of 30 selected districts of seven states to visit various places within the country to understand the cultural ethos, language and lifestyles of the people. One key aim of the initiative is to sensitize the tribal youth about their rich traditional & cultural heritage and enable them to preserve it for future generations. This is in conjunction with other existing initiatives such as the Ice Stupa Project Students’ Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh (SECMOL) under the Ministry of Tribal Affairs (Government of India), because of which villagers were able to conserve around 75 lakh litres of water in Ice-Stupas during winters and undertake eco-tourism activities like first Ladakh Ice Climbing Festival that gave the local youth an opportunity to be part of eco-entrepreneurial ventures. The Going Online as Leaders (GOAL) Program, a collaborative effort between Facebook and the Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA), was inaugurated on May 15, 2020, with the ambitious goal of digitally empowering 5,000 youth from tribal communities in India. By enlisting the expertise of 2500 industry leaders and influencers across diverse fields, the initiative aims to provide personalized mentorship to tribal youth, focusing on digital literacy, life skills, leadership, entrepreneurship, and sector-specific expertise. The comprehensive nine-month program encompasses mentorship, skill-building, and practical experience through a two-month internship, fostering holistic development among tribal mentees. There is also governmental emphasis on intergenerational knowledge transfer within tribal communities, with encouragement given to elders to actively teach younger members about endangered practices, ensuring their continuity and relevance.The Modi government has displayed a strong commitment to the conservation and promotion of tribal languages through a series of targeted initiatives. As part of the ‘Eklavya Model Residential Schools‘ program, launched in 2018, over 460 tribal languages are being preserved and taught, ensuring that indigenous linguistic diversity thrives within the formal education system. Furthermore, the ‘Tribal Language Development Program‘, introduced in 2016, focuses on documenting and revitalizing endangered tribal languages. Through this program, a substantial corpus of tribal language resources, including grammatical structures, dictionaries, and literature, has been compiled. Notably, the government’s ‘Bhasha Sangam’ initiative has celebrated linguistic diversity by featuring over 100 tribal languages on digital platforms, fostering greater recognition and appreciation of tribal linguistic heritage. By embracing digital technology, the Modi government has also launched the ‘Tribes India E-Marketplace,’ facilitating the online promotion and sale of tribal literature, art, and crafts, including works reflecting the linguistic nuances of tribal communities. These comprehensive efforts underscore the government’s dedication to preserving and nurturing the linguistic identities of India’s tribal populations. According to the NEP 2020 report, approximately 220 languages have been lost over the previous 50 years. In addition, 197 Indian languages have been listed as endangered by UNESCO. Even certain official languages included in the Indian Constitution’s Eighth Schedule face significant challenges. A facile bureaucratic procedure sometimes serves as a vehicle for the extermination of a language or dialect. The Criminal Tribes Act was enacted by the British Indian government in 1871 and only repealed in 1952. The Act stigmatised and forced some populations, usually nomadic, to hide their cultural heritage and suppress their languages. Following the 1971 Census, the Indian government declared that any indigenous language spoken by less than 10,000 people would be removed from the list of the country’s official tongues. The dialects which have been considered endangered, include seven from Manipur (Langrong, Aka, Koiren, Aimol, Lamgang, Tarao and Purum), three from Odisha (Manda, Parji and Pengo), two from Assam (Tai Nora and Tai Rong), two from Karnataka (Koraga and Kuruba), two from Arunachal Pradesh (Mra and Na), two from Andhra Pradesh (Gadaba and Naiki), one from Uttarakhand (Bangani), one from Maharashtra (Nihali), one from Jharkhand (Birhor), one from Meghalaya (Ruga), one from West Bengal (Toto), two from Tamil Nadu (Kota and Toda) and four from Himachal Pradesh (Baghati, Handuri, Pangvali and Sirmaudi). Languages such as Ghallu, Helgo, Adhuni, Dichi and Katagi have gone extinct. The Union government under the leadership of Minister of Education Dharmendra Pradhan has initiated a Scheme for the Protection and Preservation of Endangered Languages of India in December 2021 and been working with the Mysuru-based Central Institute of India Languages on the protection, preservation and documentation of all Indian language.The Union government has sanctioned over ₹864 lakh to various universities, institutes and academies for research on tribal medicinal practices and healing traditions nationwide, with the government data revealing that over ₹312 lakh has been allotted to the Patanjali Research Institute in Haridwar. The Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, operating under the AYUSH ministry, has undertaken a commendable Tribal Health Care Research Programme aimed at documenting and preserving the wealth of folk medicines and traditional practices present across diverse regions of India. Implemented through 16 peripheral institutes across the country, Tribal Health Care Research Programme not only collects valuable information but also extends healthcare services to tribal populations. Collaborative efforts with institutes like Itanagar in Arunachal Pradesh and Bangalore in Karnataka involve comprehensive medico-ethno botanical surveys, meticulously cataloguing medicinal flora and indigenous practices. The National Medicinal Plants Board, under its scheme, has similarly sponsored ethnobotanical research projects in states like Assam, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh, delving into the medicinal usage of local flora by tribal communities. The National Medicinal Plants Board’s creation of an accessible database, detailing the therapeutic attributes and habitats of over 7,000 medicinal plant species, stands as a significant resource for preserving and sharing traditional knowledge. Collaborating with CSIR, the Ministry of AYUSH established the Traditional Knowledge Digital Library, a comprehensive repository of codified texts translated into multiple languages, serving as a preventive measure against the misappropriation of India’s traditional medicinal wisdom. Furthering these efforts, the establishment of the North Eastern Institute of Folk Medicine in Arunachal Pradesh aims to safeguard and promote the rich tapestry of folk medicine practices unique to the North Eastern Region. These endeavours collectively reflect a profound commitment by the Indian government to uphold and propagate traditional healing practices while ensuring their rightful recognition and protection. The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today approved the establishment of the National Institute for Sowa-Rigpa in Leh as an autonomous organization under the Ministry of AYUSH in November 2019. Sowa-Rigpa, a traditional medical system indigenous to the Himalayan region, has found widespread popularity and practice in various Indian locales, including Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Darjeeling (West Bengal), Himachal Pradesh, and the Union Territory of Ladakh, now extending its influence throughout the entire country.Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP government has made significant strides in promoting tribal cultural resurgence in India. Through various policies and initiatives, the government has recognized and empowered tribal communities, encouraged the revival of traditional arts and crafts, preserved tribal languages, promoted festivals, improved educational facilities, and safeguarded tribal medicinal knowledge. The efforts made by the government have not only preserved the cultural diversity of India but also empowered tribal communities to actively participate in the nation’s growth and development. However, there is still much to be done to ensure that the tribal cultural heritage remains vibrant and thriving for future generations. It is imperative for the government and society as a whole to continue supporting and preserving the unique cultural identity of India’s tribal communities. The resurgence and safeguarding of tribal culture enable the restoration of traditional knowledge systems, such as Ayurveda and Sowa-Rigpa, which challenge the dominance of Western medicine and contribute to the decolonization of India’s healthcare practices. The revival of tribal cultural practices, such as the Dokra metal craft and Warli painting, helps counter the erasure of indigenous art forms caused by colonial influences, fostering cultural diversity and decolonizing artistic expressions. The resurgence of tribal culture also aids in decolonization by reinforcing land rights, as exemplified by the Forest Rights Act of 2006, which recognizes and restores tribal communities’ historic rights over forest lands, challenging colonial-era dispossession. The revival of tribal cultural practices fosters eco-friendly cultural tourism, as seen in the case of the Konkan Railways’ “Tribal Village Tourism” initiative, promoting economic growth, community well-being, and decolonization of tourism narratives. The story of Bharat is a story of its indigenous identity and heritage, and by reclaiming the narrative on Bharatiyata with an autochthonous renascence of its tribal components, we can build a truly decolonized discourse for a civilizational resurgence, in our bid to become a Vishwa Guru again.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

8,"13 October, 2023 ",Lessons from Hamas’ attack on Israel: The fake ‘Genocide of Muslims’ narrative in India will be used to justify Genocide of Hindus as ‘language of oppressed’,"Hindus need to be far more worried than Israel because the nations that stand with Israel today would not stand with Hindus when the barbarians come knocking at the door - which they do almost on a regular basisRight before dawn 5 days ago on a Saturday, Israel woke up to her worst nightmare. As the sirens blared and citizens of Israel looked for shelter, a couple of thousand Islamic terrorists from Hamas attacked the bewildered civilians from air, sea and land. As thousands of rockets and missiles rained down on Israel leaving in its wake destruction and a trail of dead bodies strewn on the streets, hundreds of terrorists on motorbikes, on foot and followed by tractors breached the fence separating Israel from Gaza. Simultaneously, terrorists also attached the beaches of Israel riding on motorbikes, overwhelming the unsuspecting Israeli soldiers. As the embers and smoke engulfed Israel, some of the Islamic terrorists descended on paragliders. After descending on Israel, the terrorists went city to city, village to village and kibbutz to kibbutz hunting down women, children and men alike. The visuals from the assault could perhaps be classified as traumatising, but worlds fall short when the Jihadi barbarity is laid threadbare, captured in images of charred bodies, burnt babies, raped and dishonoured women, and bloodied and murdered men. Several Jews were taken hostage by the terrorists as they cried and screamed for help, amidst the chants of Allahu Akbar, they were beaten, spat on, dishonoured and kidnapped – carried at the back of their trucks to Gaza. The wound of seeing babies bloodied and murdered is one that Israel and the Jewish community would perhaps never be able to heal from. From babies who slept peacefully in their cribs to partygoers dancing their worries away, where 260 of them were slaughtered, the Muslim terrorists spared none. Amidst the scent of death and blood, the wails of tragic loss, the cries for help and the screams of rage, Israel rose as one. Several Israelis travelled back from wherever they were in the world to seek justice – to seek retribution. Old, young, men and women got called into duty – to defend the civilisational home of the Jews and to ensure those who had the blood of children and women on their hands paid a price for their barbarism. Israel then began to pound Gaza with rockers and missiles, flattening whatever stood in its path. On the 13th of October, Israel asked 1.1 million Palestinians to move from the North to the South – the instruction included for UN officials and those hiding in their premises to relocate as well – signalling that Israel was ready for a ground assault. Israel has also shut down the water and electricity supply of Palestine. Israel pleaded with the world – don’t look away. Look at the biggest onslaught against Jews since the Holocaust. Look at what the Islamic terrorists have done. They have killed our babies. Raped our women. Beheaded our sons. They want us gone – annihilated – murdered – humiliated. Don’t. Look. Away – they pleaded. They pleaded because they knew that as a country that fights for its very survival everyday will not be cowered down and that retribution will be theirs. As expected, when Israel started responding to Palestine’s mass violence against Jews, the narrative was not too kind to them, despite the fact that most countries which often gloss over Islamist violence came out vehemently in support of Israel – USA for example. Almost immediately, the narrative shifted to the brewing humanitarian crisis in Palestine with Israel shutting off its water and electricity supply. In one video, the former Prime Minister of Israel screamed – What is wrong with you? We are fighting the Nazis. How can you expect us to give water and electricity to our enemies”. 'Are you seriously asking me about Palestinian civilians? What is wrong with you? We're fighting Nazis.'Former Israeli PM Naftali Bennett adds 'if Hamas use anyone as a human shield, it is their responsibility.'https://t.co/PAiZ4D1jU3📺 Sky 501 pic.twitter.com/19nBKjOYOQThe media, however, continued what it does best – whitewash the crimes of Muslims and blame the victims of violence of genocide when they choose to stand up and say – ‘Thus far and no further’. The essence of these articles was simple – Israel is committing a genocide of Palestinians by way of its retaliatory action after Jews were raped, murdered, beheaded or injured. They were careful – though. They were careful to also give a “context” to the Palestinian attack against Israel. In an article headlined, “Palestinian Americans, Dismayed by Violence, Say Historical Context Is Being Overlooked”, The New York Times essentially provided context to the mass murder of rape of Jews by Islamic terrorists. The article said, “In interviews with more than a dozen Palestinian Americans, many said they were saddened by the violence against civilians, both Israeli and Palestinian, and hoped for a peaceful resolution. But many said that the underlying causes of the conflict could be traced to the policies of Israel and the United States, and decades of Palestinians being denied freedom of movement and basic rights”. The subtle agenda-pushing is a work of art that must be fully appreciated. In the article, the New York Times essentially pushes the narrative that Palestinians are lovely people who are very very… very sad about the “loss of lives” in Israel. They are empathetic and don’t support terrorism of any form. However, they are also terribly sad that the USA and perhaps the rest of the world are not understanding the historical context of why these lovely, peaceful, delightful people from Palestine raped, beheaded and tortured Jews in Israel. In turn and as a result, while it was the Jews who got raped, beheaded and tortured, it was the Palestinians who were the real victims not only because Israel launched a counteroffensive against them but also because the barbaric, Islamophobic world was refusing to understand why the Palestinians were forced to murder babies, rape women, behead civilians and torture/murder the men. Further in the New York Times article, another Palestinian is quoted saying the following: “These statements are really dehumanizing us,” she said, “and telling us that our lives are not worth anything.” In the eyes of those officials, she added, “we are never the victim, we are always the aggressor.”This statement was made in response to US’ support to Israel and statements demanding action against Hamas for their misadventure. But do you see what happened here? While the entire article asserted that the Muslims were the victims whether they were killing Israelis, facing retaliatory action or celebrating the murder of Jews, the Palestinian quoted here craftily plays victim to negate the incontrovertible fact that Islamic terrorists are indeed the aggressors. While these op-eds try to paint the Islamic terrorists as “Gandhis with guns”, they gloss over the fact that Gaza has been officially ruled by Hamas since 2017. They gloss over the fact that it is not just Hamas – Palestinians take to the streets to celebrate atrocities against Jews on a regular basis. They gloss over the fact that they may attempt to differentiate between Hamas and civilian Palestinians, but even the civilian Palestinians don’t differentiate between the state of Israel and average, civilian Jews because in the Hamas onslaught, celebrated by Palestinians and Muslims across the globe, those killed were average Jews, average Israelis – women, children, elderly. When we look at the incidents in Israel, this is what the apologists want the world to believe. Interestingly, there is an uncanny parallel to how the world arm twists Hindus every time they come under the attack of Islamists. The parallels of the narrative being crafted post-Hamas violence in Israel and the narrative which is crafted every single time Hindus come under the assault of Islamists have several parallels and lessons that Hindus can draw. While Hamas burnt alive Jewish victims in Israel, Dilbar Negi’s hands and legs were chopped off and he was burnt alive by Islamists in India just 3 years ago. The narrative has been eerily constant regardless of established facts – whether we discuss the partition horrors against Hindus or the current aggressions against Hindus. In this regard, it would bode well to remember the case of Mahashay Rajpal, who published Rangeela Rasool and was ultimately assassinated for it. We mostly hear that Mahashay Rajpal was assassinated for publishing a satirical work on Prophet Muhammad called Rangeela Rasool, but we seldom hear why he chose to publish the book. In 1923, Muslims published two particularly offensive books to Hindus. “Krishna teri geeta jalani padegi” used derogatory and vulgar language against Shri Krishna and other Hindu deities and “Uniseevi sadi ka maharshi” which contained derogatory remarks on Arya Samaj founder Swami Dayanand Saraswati (incidentally written by an Ahmadi).In response to this provocation by Islamists, Pandit Chamupati Lal, a close friend of Mahashay Rajpal, wrote a short biography of the Islamic Prophet, Mohammed. “Rangeela Rasool” was a short pamphlet which satirised the life of the Prophet of Islam. Pandit Chamupati made Mahashay Rajpal promise that he would never reveal the name of the author – he knew the consequences of it. Anonymously published under the name “doodh ka doodh aur panee ka panee”, the book enraged Muslims. Staying true to the values of one-way brotherhood, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi wrote in his pamphlet “Young India”, condemning Rangeela Rasool. While Gandhi ignored the provocation by Muslims, by the end of June 1924, the colonial government banned the book. The Muslim community, partly emboldened by MK Gandhi’s endorsement of their hurt sentiments and whitewashing of the provocation against Hindus, filed multiple cases against the book under 153A. In May 1927, Mahashay Rajpal, who published the book, was acquitted of all charges with the court observing that commentary based on facts on historical figures, including the prophet of Islam, cannot be said to promote enmity between groups. As soon as the verdict was delivered, Muslim mobs went into a frenzy. They rioted and demanded the head of Mahashay Rajpal. They were chants about how the murder of Rajpal was acceptable because, under Sharia, the punishment for blasphemy is death.On April 6th, 1929 a 19-year-old carpenter named Ilm ud din stabbed Mahashay Rajpal on his chest eight times while he was seated in the outer verandah of his shop. Though he was offered to give up the name of the author, Pandit Chamupati Lal, during the court proceedings, he refused and did not yield. He paid the price for it. He paid the price for publishing that book despite the court acquitting him and the Muslims getting a special law to protect their fragile feelings. Before Mahashay Rajpal was murdered brutally, the Muslims got their way and got 295A passed by the British, which aimed to protect their ever-outraged feelings. In this case too, it was the Islamists who mounted the initial onslaught by publishing books insulting Hindus. It was the Hindus who published one book in return. The response to that was the Muslims going on a rampage, rioting, committing violence and beheading Mahashay Rajpal. Through it all, it was the Hindus who were condemned by MK Gandhi while the Muslims, who indulged in violence, became the eternal victims getting a law to protect their feelings. Any conversation around this subject, till date, conveniently glosses over the Muslims publishing the two books first and their rampant violence later – what is remembered is that Hindus published a book that hurt Muslims and that Hindus are the community that must be blamed for the murder of Mahashay Rajpal because the Muslim hurt was justified. Not too long after India was torn apart by those who were convinced that the Muslim community could be placated. Before the Rangeela Rasool controversy, Hindus saw the Khilafat movement, and the support it got from Congress and Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and after that, Hindus saw the rise of a Muslim leader like Mohammad Ali Jinnah, leading India’s partition.16th August 1946 was the day when the call to massacre Hindus of Bengal was given by Muslim League founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah. Bengal, the only province in India under Muslim League rule at that time, was apparently chosen by the Muslim League leadership as the suitable place to unleash terror on Hindus in the name of “Direct Action”.In 1946, the massacre of Hindus in Bengal was rather intricately planned. Jinnah is recalled having said that he would either have India divided or India burnt and that he had given up on Constitutional methods to demand the creation of Pakistan. Jinnah had chosen the 16th of August as Direction Action Day because it was the 18th day of Ramzan, the day when the Battle of Badr was fought and won – a war fought by Prophet Muhammad himself, against the Kaffirs, and is considered to be won by Allah’s divine intervention by Muslims. The battle led to the violent occupation of Mecca. On the 16th of August, Calcutta was littered with posters lionising Jinnah and reminding Muslims that they had to follow the footsteps of the Prophet. It is reported that Syed Muhammad Usman, mayor of Calcutta, had issued a widely circulated leaflet that said: Kafer! Toder dhongsher aar deri nei! Sarbik hotyakando ghotbei! (Infidels! Your end is not far away! You will be massacred!). The aim was to make Bengal ‘land of the pure’ and rid it of the Kaffirs (Hindus). The aim was to wage another Battle of Badr, in which the Muslims would conquer the heathens. What followed on the 16th right after the Jumma Namaz is Muslims going on a rampage, beheading Hindus, chopping their limbs off and raping Hindu women. Several women were taken as sex slaves by those who were fighting with the religious fervour of the Battle of Badr. In the Kesoram Cotton Mills at Lichubagan in the Muslim-dominated Metiabruz area, Muslim mobs entered and beheaded over 600 labourers. The Hindus, neutered and asked by Gandhi to die with a smile on their face hardly fought back. There was a mass exodus from Bengal that marked millions fleeing because the massacre seemed too brutal to fight against.When Gopal Patha rose to defend the Hindus, it was MK Gandhi who asked him to lay down his weapons. The retaliatory, self-defence action by the Hindus were deemed the original onslaught and the openly religious violence against the Hindus were pushed under the rug to ensure that the Muslims continued to be the universal and eternal victims. Despite the historical atrocities committed by Muslims against Hindus, today, the Media goes no overdrive trying to push the narrative that there is an impending genocide against Muslims that the world is waiting to witness in India. Reams are written on how Hindus harbour animosity against the Muslims, depriving them of their legitimate rights, lynching them, killing them and humiliating them – building up to a genocide – much like that committed supposedly by Israel against Palestine. History and the current onslaught have been systematically whitewashed by historians, scholars, politicians and the corporate media – to an extent that the world has failed to see the realities of the Hindu population. Let us take the Nuh violence recently for example. Thousands of Muslims had descended on Hindus travelling to an area where the dominant demography was of Muslims. they were travelling there to simply worship Lord Shiva on an auspicious day for Hindus. They were pelted with stones, their cars burnt, held hostage inside the temples where the hostages included women and children and attacked with bullets, acid pouches and petrol bombs. Through it all, the narrative was that somehow, it was the Hindus who had provoked the violence because a) they dared to take out a religious procession in an area where Muslims predominantly live after ghettoizing the area and driving Hindus away and b) because of a rumour that a Hindu activist that the Muslims don’t like might be present at the procession – a lie which was spread by the Islamists themselves. Here is how Le Monde wrote about the Nuh violence. First, they turned one-way violence by the Islamists into “violence between Hindus and Muslims” simply because after the one-way violence, the Hindus had decided to defend themselves. Then, they blamed Hindu organisations for “genocide” and “terror” because they dared to speak about the violence and asserted that they would not accept attacks against Hindus. See a pattern with what is happening in Israel? The Islamists unleash violence. Their violence is justified as the language of the oppressed. When Jews decide to defend themselves and retaliate, they are called the aggressors and the terrorists who unleashed violence continue to be the victims, with the real victims being blamed for unleashing hate and genocide simply because they chose to defend themselves. After the brutal beheading of Kanhaiya Lal by two Muslims who then uploaded the beheading video on social media, holding the blood-dripping knife, global media blamed Hindus for asserting that their lives matter too. Here is what the TIME published. At the very onset, author Mansoor shifted the discourse from the beheading of Kanhaiya Lal to supposed ‘chilling calls for revenge’ against the ‘marginalised’ Muslim population. While trying to contextualise the murder of Kanhaiya Lal, Sanya Mansoor suggested that the poor Hindu tailor had drawn the wrath of the Islamists upon himself by supporting the ‘derogatory comments’ of ex-BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma. Meanwhile, Mansoor also tried to shield the co-religionists of the killers and praise them for their token condemnations. “Muslim politicians and Islamic preachers swiftly condemned the killing,” she asserted while conveniently ignoring their collective silence over calls of ‘Sarr tan se juda chants all over India backed by the same people.Do you see the parallels? Here they are: When a Muslim gets lynched because he was a thief and primarily for such reasons, the media and the global world order are quick to call it an onslaught against Muslims by Hindus, however, when Hindus are lynched, beheaded, raped and murdered for explicitly religious reasons amidst the chants of Allahu Akbar, the Hindus have been historically blamed for the violence by the Muslims claiming that the Muslims are indulging in violence because the Hindus have somehow enraged them enough to go on a justified murderous rampage. To prove their point, they even invent crimes where they claim Muslims were beaten up amid Hindu religious slogans simply to justify crimes against Hindus amid chants of Allahu Akbar. They’re lies, screamed from the mountaintops versus our truths meekly repeated, with nobody to listen to us – that is the battle that Hindus have been fighting for millennia. History shows that progressively, a violent minority has strengthened the legislative, judicial and societal cover it gets to assert its religious supremacy aspirations. These aspirations are often negotiated after a violent, vehement and shameless assertion of street veto. The State and leaders who are meant to protect Bharat have bent a knee to the street veto and tried their damndest to assuage the perennially offended, the often violent and the perpetually demanding lot. Their constitutional special status keeps getting reaffirmed either by politicians or the judiciary in the hopes that the ever-so-offended lot will not take to the streets and indulge in rampant violence which the state is woefully incapable of controlling simply to prove just how downtrodden and oppressed they truly are. The intolerant minority has often held a sword to Hindus’ neck and forced us to concede that we have oppressed the sword-wielders.In this bargain, the global world order and the media has followed the pattern of demonising the victims of Islamic violence – the Hindus – and paint the aggressors – the Islamists – and the perpetual victims. In the case of Israel, we see large acceptance of their persecution and acknowledgement of her right to retaliate. Even then, the narrative demonising the Jews for fighting for their survival and civilisational identity is strong enough to spark violence and protests against the victims. Hindus have failed to do what the Jews have done spectacularly well – make the world aware of their own genocide, and their own persecution and ensure that normalisation of that hate is not only a punishable offence but one for which the society itself might ostracise you. We saw that play out after Hamas’ attack against Israel – those students from Harvard who blamed Israel for the terror attack against Jews by Islamic terrorists were forced to retract their statements because corporations started pulling away their job offers. The USA – which when it comes to India whitewashes the Islamic terrorists, was grieved and stood firmly behind Israel’s right to self-defence. The Muslim nations that wanted Israel wiped out mostly stood by mute because they knew the world stood by Israel and her right to self-preservation. As Israel flattens Palestine, there is recognition to some extent that the Jews, especially after suffering from the horrors of the Holocaust, will not stand by and get wiped out again. In India, however, partly because of the failure of Hindus themselves and the systematic whitewashing of history and news by scholars, political leaders and the corporate media, wails of persecution often go unnoticed. In fact, they don’t just go unnoticed, the narrative that we see media, Islamists and Leftists build against Israel today, is a constant against India with other players supporting Israel today joining in as well. Hindus need to be far more worried than Israel because the nations that stand with Israel today would not stand with Hindus when the barbarians come knocking at the door – which they do almost on a regular basis – because our own leaders are a part of the narrative demonising Hindus. Take Rahul Gandhi for example and how he today shields Islamists by calling IUML secular, endorsing calls to wipe out Sanatan Dharma, seeking foreign intervention to stop the Hindus and a caste census back home to divide the persecuted. The world will look away as Hindus get slaughtered and the narrative being crafted will blame Hindus for their own persecution and genocide, claiming that the violence unleashed by the Islamists is the “Language of the oppressed” – they are doing that today with Israel – but it would be far easier to do it with Hindus because, unlike Israel, we have traitors amongst ourselves and a world that has normalised persecution of Hindus after we failed to talk about our own plight for centuries. Today, far more than ever, Hindus need to learn from the Jews. Bharat needs to learn from Israel. If we don’t talk about our own persecution – nobody will. If we don’t protect our honour – nobody will. If we don’t stand up to our murderers being painted as the victims – nobody will. And if today we don’t realise the threats of Islamic terror and how it comes even for those who weep for the self-proclaimed marginalised Islamists today. The Hindus’ collective right to retain the cultural, religious and ethical integrity of the only land they have has to be held sacrosanct – legislatively, judicially and socially.

9,"10 October, 2023 ","There is no common brotherhood, only ‘common enemy’: How the Ummah ignores millions of Muslim victims but gets together against Jews, Hindus, and Christians","There has been a shocking outpouring of support for Hamas around the world. Thousands of Muslims, regardless of their ethnicity and nationality, have gathered in the streets of Western nations, where they enjoy the privileges of democracy and freedom of expression, to declare open support for the brutal slaughter of women, children, and hundreds of unsuspecting civilians.Since Israel declared war following the Hamas terrorist attacks and ground invasion, the majority of the Arab world has rallied in support of Palestine. These countries have a long history of supporting the “Palestinian” cause. However, their support doesn’t stem from the perceived notion of religious fraternity and common brotherhood, colloquially referred to as the concept of Ummah instead it is driven by the hatred for dehumanised non-believers, pejoratively called ‘Kafirs’ (infidels) and shared theological believe of a common enemy. Conspicuously, the responses of the Arab world vis-a-vis alleged atrocities on Muslims by non-believers as against that of Muslims on Muslims underscores the exploitative and preposterous concept called “convenience of victimhood” to serve the end goal of justifying the ‘annihilation’ of non-believers. Here are some antecedents revealing how support for Palestine or Muslims being ‘persecuted’ around the world serves as just a tool to usher in Dar-ul-Islam and make the world ridden from infidelity.  Israel-Palestine neighbours Syria, Egypt, and Jordan among others have fought wars citing the cause of Palestinians, however, they all share a dark history of persecuting Palestinians on their soil or mercilessly committing crimes against the population, which they allege Israel commits against Palestinian Muslims. Evidently, on 17th September 1970, Jordan carried out a massacre of thousands of Palestinians which is notorious as ‘Black September’ for Palestinians. Fifty years ago, King Hussein ordered the Jordanian Army to massacre militants in the refugee camps situated around Amman. Following the royal orders, the Jordanian army launched a brutal crackdown in a bid to retake control of territory occupied by the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) in Jordan.  According to the 2015 census data, there are around 634,000 Palestinians in Jordan out of the total population of 9.5 million. However, Human Rights organisations claim that half of the Jordan population is Palestinian. The ruling Hashemite dynasty of Jordan fears the large population of Palestinians in the country has the power to destabilise the empire.Meanwhile, Pakistan has a deep interest in supporting the Palestinian cause which increased, especially after India started strengthening its relationship with Israel in the 1990s. However, Pakistani leaders have avoided discussing this chapter in Palestinian history: the events of Black September in Jordan in 1970. Notably, Pakistan played a major hand in exterminating Palestinian ‘terrorists’ hiding in refugee camps. Jordan had sought the assistance of Pakistan to train its newly equipped army. As a result, the critical training for the Jordanian army was provided by Pakistan.Another neighbor, Syria which earlier used to mollycoddle Hamas, it acted against Palestinians when they exploited and aggravated civil war in Syria, the nation which was hosting them. Apparently, Syria used to host Hamas leadership, but it had a fallout with Syrian authorities after the Palestinian refugees participated in the 2011 uprising that preceded the Syrian Civil War. However, normal Gazans or Palestinians didn’t share the same fate as their top brass for participating in the Syrian Civil War. While the Hamas leadership was just shunned from the country, ordinary Palestinians (despite hailing from the Muslim faith) were brutally hacked to death. According to private data gathered by the Action Group for Palestinians of Syria (AGPS), they documented the death of at least 4,013 Palestinians as a result of the war in Syria. The victims included 614 refugees who had died of torture inside Syrian regime prisons and detention centres and 205 who had died due to lack of medical care and the tight siege imposed by the Syrian regime army on the Yarmouk camp in Damascus, the AGPS had revealed. Israeli politician Golda Meir once famously said, “We will have peace with the Arabs when they love their children more than they hate us”. The same does not just apply to Islamic countries, it also applies to Hamas (Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya) which uses the civilian population of Gazans to materialize their hatred for Jews.Notably, Hamas has been using civilian sites like hospitals, religious sites, or educational institutions to launch rocket or missile attacks and exploit civilians as cannon fodder. The Israeli Defence Forces demonstrated an example of a religious site that was hit by the Israeli Air Force as it was used by Hamas to launch a terror attack on Israel.Israeli civilians are not Hamas’ only victim.Hamas intentionally positions itself deep among Gaza's population. For example…this terrorist site that the Israel Air Force targeted, located next to a mosque and just a football field away from a school. pic.twitter.com/ROs3iMdnLzThe Rafah Border Crossing, also known as the Rafah Crossing Point, serves as the sole crossing point between Egypt and the Gaza Strip. It is located on the Gaza–Egypt border, which was recognised by the 1979 Egypt–Israel peace treaty. However, Egypt has a long history of prohibiting Gazan refugees from entering its territory to avoid its negative security implications. Cairo which has suffered the brunt of Islamic State (IS) or Daesh, has feared infiltration of Hamas terrorists in the guise of Palestinians, particularly Gazan refugees. Even today, soon after the Hamas terrorists imposed an unprovoked war on Israel, Egyptian security closed this sole border crossing for Gazans. The reports of it were confirmed by the Israeli officials who had earlier asked the Gazans to cross over to Egypt in the wake of its retaliatory strikes on Hamas terror sites. However, later they had to clarify that the Rafah crossing was open yesterday, but now it is closed.BREAKING: Egypt has closed the Rafah crossing with Gaza's southern borderThe Rafah border crossing has remained predominantly closed since Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in June 2007. Even when Egypt makes some concessions, it only allows those who require medical treatment or have foreign residency permits to cross the borders, a move targeted toward Hamas terrorists. Do you know why #Egypt doesn't open the #Rafah border crossing with #Gaza to let 2.3 million Palestinians living there flee? This is because 8 out of every 10 Palestinian men living in #Gaza are terrorists or terrorism supporters! For years, Egypt has suffered from #ISIL/#Daesh,… pic.twitter.com/zD0C89d7pAStrikingly, the Egyptian fear revolving around the entry of Hamas terrorists in the guise of Gazan refugees stems from the fact that Hamas has in the past targeted the Rafah border and Egyptian border personnel including blowing it up with explosives. One such incident was reported on 23 January 2008, when Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip set off an explosion near the Rafah border crossing, destroying part of the 2003 wall.Meanwhile, Israel had already sealed its border crossings with the Palestinian enclave, allowing in only humanitarian aid and basic supplies which have been cut post the 7th October Hamas terrorist attack on Israeli citizens.Earlier, Hamas used to amass funds to the tune of $12 million per month from taxes on Egyptian goods imported or smuggled into Gaza through tunnels. Notably, Gaza shares a 12 km long border with Egypt on its south and Rafah is the sole border crossing. However, in 2013, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi assumed power. Since then, Cairo has ended Hamas’s operation as it asserts that Hamas is an extension of the Muslim Brotherhood, which is again a dreaded and designated terrorist organisation.  Afterward, the Egyptian military closed down the majority of tunnels that were crossing into its territory. This action took place during their campaign against a faction affiliated with the self-declared Islamic State on their side of the border, within the Sinai Peninsula. Recently, Jordan implemented a policy that can’t be further from the concept of “Common brotherhood” or the antithesis of catering to the Ummah brotherhood. Evidently, Jordan which was perceived as a host accepting millions of Palestinian, Iraqi, and Syrian refugees on the lines of the Universal Muslim Brotherhood, had taken a hard turn. Experts have pointed out that the “Jordan Initiative” unveiled in May will radically change Jordan from one of the world’s most accommodating hosts to one of its biggest proponents for sending refugees home. Regarding this, deputy director of the Middle East and North Africa division at Human Rights Watch, Adam Coogle said, “Jordan long has said that refugees are welcome. But now the official rhetoric has moved toward supporting their return. It’s a cause for significant concern.”Similarly, Lebanon and Turkey have speeded up the deportation of hundreds of Syrians, their Muslim brethren, since April to speed up their exodus from their so-called “pro-Ummah” nation.  Likewise, Pakistan, the vociferous proponent of Ummah, has recently asked millions of Afghan refugees to leave the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Afghan refugees who had fled their nation when the Taliban took over Kabul and had been living in Pakistan have been reportedly given only four weeks time to return, forcing them to choose between the brutalities of two co-religionist nations, Pakistan or Afghanistan.  On the basis of Ummah, persecuted Muslim citizens/refugees of war-torn Yemen should have garnered the same support as they have been suffering from a brutal war, starvation, and cholera that have been ruining lives. However, this is not the case because co-religionists are involved in this war and there is no “convenience of victimhood” involved in the Yemeni conflict to furtherance the cause of Dar-ul-Islam or fighting/killing the infidel. There is a war in Yemen, there is a war in Syria, there is a war in Sudan, and there is a war in Lybia. Muslims are killing Muslims in all these wars, thousands of victims, did you see any protests in New York, London, Berlin, ..? Why?Because for many Muslims they do not really…The same goes for Syrian, Sudanese, and Libyan refugees, Muslims being persecuted by terrorism in Africa and elsewhere, attract no whispers of support as they don’t have the binding clue – common enemy. Islamic nations like Pakistan, Iran, Turkiye, Palestine, Lebanon, etc have committed sins on their own native Muslim sects – Ahmediyas, Balochs, and Sindhis etc in Pakistan, Hamas killing dissenting Muslims and Fatah leadership, etc. Fighting for common brotherhood, persecuted Muslims and atrocities, and ethnic cleansing in Muslim countries by Muslim leadership have always been brushed under the carpet.     Instead, the outcry for atrocities is targeted at non-believers for causing hindrance to their dehumanising and Jihadi acts –reflected in the anti-Semitic, anti-Hindu, anti-Western (Christ-believing countries) calls, like “Gas the Jews”, asking Pakistanis to kill ‘Hindus’, death to Israel and “death to America” in the Iranian parliament.  Palestinian Islamic Scholar Nidhal Siam's Anti Hindu speechAnd they're Supporting Palestine pic.twitter.com/fdsQQGgs0hThe latest hatred towards the “common enemy” is clear from the fact that the Arab world has refrained from condemning the propensity of crime committed on innocent Israeli citizens. On 7th October, Hamas terrorists launched a war involving rocket barrages and ground invasion into Israeli territories killing unsuspecting Israelis and other foreign nationals present in their sight. In the catastrophic invasion of Israel, more than 700 Israeli citizens have lost their lives, hundreds of children, girls, and the elderly have been taken hostage with Hamas terrorists giving open threats to behead them and air the beheadings, rape being used as weapons of war, bared and bruised bodies of women being paraded in streets. Conspicuously, these assaults were inflicted on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah and the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.There has been a shocking outpouring of support for Hamas around the world. Thousands of Muslims, regardless of their ethnicity and nationality, have gathered in the streets of Western nations, where they enjoy the privileges of democracy and freedom of expression, to declare open support for the brutal slaughter of women, children, and hundreds of unsuspecting civilians. Be it Australia or Canada, the UK or the USA, the Palestinian cause has seen overwhelming support. However, the same people have never stood for the millions of malnourished children in Yemen, they never cared for the little girls deprived of schooling in Afghanistan, or the Muslims victimized by terrorists in Africa. The global Muslim population conspicuously lacks concerns for legitimate human rights abuses and atrocities when the perpetrators are their own people. It only unites when the enemy is the “other”, the Jew, the Hindu, or the Christian. Simply put, they just want to see the end of non-believers, one excruciating death after another and Jews had always been the first in line followed by Hindus and Christians with rejected/outcasted Muslim sects like Ahmediyas in between. Iran’s fanatism to have nuclear power demonstrates that it just wants to destroy the Jewish state and to achieve that it is ready to spend dozens of Gazas and Palestinians and Lebanon etc. The first hallucination of the usage of nuclear arsenal will be on Israel, taking away the existence of their beloved Palestinian Muslim brethren, for whom such wars are claimed to be fought for and such brutality are being justified.    Meanwhile, in the non-Arab world, leaders from across the world, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden have expressed their solidarity and support for Israel at its difficult hour. It wouldn’t be wrong to say that Common victimhood has become a tool, while common brotherhood is just a blatant lie, the only thing that unites the Muslim world, in general, is the hatred of the ‘common enemy’ – Israel, followed by Hindus and Christians with outcasted Muslim sects in between.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

10,"21 October, 2023 ","Welfare Party of India may be an example of communist stupidity in supporting terror, but they didn’t use the Italy flag to support Palestine: Fact Check","The flag of the Welfare Party of India has remarkable similarity with the Italian flag, as both the flags are made of vertical panels of green, white and red. However, in the party's flag, there is a yellow olive leaves symbol and the words 'Welfare Party' in the middle panelAs Israel continues its military action against Hamas in Gaza in retaliation to the horrific terror attack on Israel by Hamas, Islamists and leftists worldwide, who are traditionally anti-Israel, are protesting against Israel and in support of Hamas and Palestine. A similar protest march in support of Palestinians was taken out by the Kerala-based Welfare Party of India in Kerala on Friday, 20 October in Palakkad in Kerala.However, when the photos and videos of the protest started appearing on social media, people started mocking the Welfare Party of India, saying that it was carrying the flag of Italy instead of the flag of Palestine. In the photos, the protestors were seen carrying a large number of flags which looked like the Italian flag.HILARIOUS: The Welfare Party in Kerala, India took out a rally in favor of Palestinians, but they brought ITALIAN flags instead of the Palestinian flag. 😂 #FreeItaly https://t.co/GKRCuyYuYUAs both the flags of Italy and Palestine contain the same colours, red, green and white, people assumed that the party mistakenly picked the wrong flag for the protest. The protestors were seen carrying a large banner saying ‘Free Palestine’, apart from the flag with green, white and red vertical bands.“Socialist stupidity and Jew hatred are once again proven to be a package deal,” tweeted activist and radio talk show host Charlie Kirk.Thousands of members of the Welfare Party in Kerala, India march with Italian flags mistaking then for the Palestinian flag, while holding letters that read: “Free Palestien”Socialist stupidity and Jew hatred are once again proven to be a package deal. pic.twitter.com/YLYAB4A53SMany other X users posted similar tweets, mocking the political party for carrying the Italian flag instead of the Palestinian flag.Welfare Party of India in Kerala took out this rally in support of Palestine but with flag of Italy.

This is because they were carrying neither the Italian flag nor the Palestinian flag, they were carrying the flag of their own party.The flag of the Welfare Party of India has remarkable similarity with the Italian flag, as both the flags are made of vertical panels of green, white and red. However, there is a difference.In the Italian flag, all three panels are blank, but in the WPI flag, there are design elements in the white part in the middle. It has the olive leaves symbol in yellow and the words ‘Welfare Party’ written vertically in black inside the white panel.As the videos shared by the social media users are of low resolution, the yellow leaves symbol is mostly not visible against the white background. But parts of the words ‘Welfare Party’ in black are visible in some of the flags if the videos are observed carefully.Moreover, in other images and videos of the protest posted by the party and others, it is clearly seen that it is the party flag, not the Italian flag.In the video posted in the tweet below, which has better resolution, the yellow leaves symbol and black letters saying ‘Welfare Party’ are clearly seen in the flags carried in a pro-Palestine march by the party in Kozhikode.#Gaza_Genocide#IndiaWithPalestine: Massive rally in Kozhikode, Kerala – India by welfare party of India Kerala against #Israel's atrocities in #Palestine!Hundreds join in solidarity with #Gaza, chanting slogans like '#FreePalestine' and 'Stop #Gaza_Genocide'! pic.twitter.com/qE3ElKVkacTherefore, while the Welfare Party’s support for Palestinians is questionable given the horrific terror attack on Israel, the party didn’t make any mistake in picking the flag for the protest. People mocked them because their flag is almost similar to the Italian flag, assuming they were mistaking it for the Palestinian flag which has the same colours with the addition of a black panel.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

11,"13 October, 2023 ",Did a Hamas supporter accidentally set himself on fire while burning the Israeli flag? Know the truth behind the video which has gone viral,"The video is an old one from 2021 and the incident happened during the Al-Quds Day protest that was carried out in Iran in May that year.The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas has resulted in mass genocide, killing over 1300 Israelis and injuring hundreds more. As the Israel-Hamas war rages, a video went viral which showed a man unintentionally lighting himself on fire while burning an Israeli flag.The video has been widely shared on X since yesterday (October 12), with most of the users alleging that it was a Hamas supporter who attempted to burn the Israeli flag amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. They mocked the Hamas supporter saying that Karma paid him back. An X user @Hariindic shared the video with the caption, “Look at the current situation of Hamas – Hamas supporter accidentally set himself on fire! Karma works wonders.”#Hamas situation right now😂🇮🇱🇵🇸 WATCH: Hamas supporter accidentally sets himself on fire! Karma acts in wonderful ways.#Israel #IsraelPalestineWar #HamasMassacre #GazaUnderAttack #HamasTerrorism #Gaza_under_attack #HamasTerrorists #Palestine #GazaUnderAttack #Gaza pic.twitter.com/4pNnGgG6CbIn the footage, a man is seen holding a massive Israeli flag. Another man approached the man who was holding the flag and set it on fire. Within seconds, due to the direction of the wind, the clothes of the man who is holding the flag also catch fire. The man immediately drops the flag on the ground and scampers away after his clothes catch fire. Amusingly, the group of protestors who were seen standing beside him holding Palestinian flags, instead of coming to his rescue, quickly moved away from him to save themselves from the fire.Though the video was being shared extensively on X, formally Twitter, OpIndia decided to do some investigation, after which we learned that the video was an old one that resurfaced in the midst of the recent Israel-Hamas confrontation. Even in 2021, the same video was shared by numerous social media accounts. The majority of these accounts belonged to Muslim people who had posted the video to express their hostility towards Israelis.خداوندا مارا از دست پیروانت نجات بده.God, save us from your followers pic.twitter.com/T3xGT5ImJyIn fact, the Times of Israel reported about the incident in May 2021. The media report shared the same video posted by several X users then, claiming that the video was from the Al-Quds Day protest that was carried out in Iran on May 7 2021.Let us inform you that in 1979, the year of the Islamic Revolution, Iran established Al-Quds Day, or Jerusalem Day. The Iranian government marks the day with anti-Israel rallies, demonstrations, and threats to “liberate” Jerusalem from Israeli rule.In conclusion, despite the fact that the video has recently gone viral amid the ongoing Israel and Hamas war, it is an old one from Iran and does not feature any Hamas supporters or terrorists. Though here too, the Israeli flag was burnt in a show of sympathy for Palestine and a show of anger against Israel.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

12,"7 October, 2023 ",Fact Check: Did 121 people die because of the shutting down of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi,"Earlier in September this year, the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi came under the scanner over the death of a 22-year-old woman named Divya Shukla. Days after the Allahabad High Court stayed the suspension on the licence of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi, social media was rife with disinformation about the death of 121 people in the Munshiganj area of the city.On Friday (6th October), a propaganda news outlet by the name of ‘4 pm’ interviewed an alleged employee of the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital, who made outrageous claims about the death of 121 patients due to lack of medical attention.An alleged nursing staffer by the name of Saurabh Mishra claimed that a whopping 121 residents of Amethi died due to the closure of the hospital. “Some are dying en route to Lucknow, others are not getting medicines on time. There are not even cotton swabs and bandages,” he claimed “Around 121 patients have died in just 15 days,” Mishra continued. “This is the politics of vengeance…They (BJP) hate Gandhis,” he brazened out. Prior to him, another alleged employee of the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital named Umashankar Pandey claimed that the licence of the medical facility was suspended due to the BJP’s disdain for the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty.“Smriti Irani (MP from Amethi constituency) hates the fact that ‘Gandhi’ name is attached to the hospital. Now, they (BJP) are hurting the employability of small-time workers,” he was heard as saying. After the clips of the video went viral online, the Congress system exploited the opportunity to create hysteria about the supposed death of more than 120 people in Amethi.It must be mentioned that the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi is run by the Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Trust (SGMT), which is headed by Congress supremo Sonia Gandhi.Congress loyalist Shantanu claimed, “In hate of Rahul Gandhi and the Gandhi family, @smritiirani and the BJP govt of Uttar Pradesh took lives of 121 people as the functioning of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital was stopped…” He later deleted his tweet.flesh alive passed the sell by date.The max sucking power of her throat and lungs it's all down hill from here,1.6 B Indian slaves being treated like animals.Shame on dirty Indian politics/politicians.Feku &Gang should be hanged, not worth living on planet earth.Sooner the betterOther propaganda artists also shared the claims about the death of 121 patients. On Friday (6th October) night, the District Magistrate & Collector of Amethi, Rakesh Kumar Mishra, rubbished the false claims being propagated on social media.एकदम भ्रामक एवं गलत बात कही जा रही है। किसी की मृत्यु नहीं हुई हैं। जनपद अमेठी के सभी सरकारी चिकित्सालयों में दवा आदि की कोई कमी नहीं है। तथ्य के विपरीत जनस्वास्थ्य के बारे में अफवाह फैलाने के विरूद्ध वैधानिक कार्यवाही की जाएगी ।“Completely misleading and wrong things are being shared. No one has died. There is no shortage of medicines in any government hospital of Amethi district,” he informed. “Legal action will be taken against spreading rumours about public health contrary to facts,” the District Magistrate of Amethi warned.Earlier in September this year, the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi came under the scanner over the death of a 22-year-old woman named Divya Shukla. The victim went into a state of coma after being administered anaesthesia, prior to a kidney stone operation.Shukla was then referred to Medanta Hospital in Lucknow, where she eventually passed away. The district administration ordered the closure of the hospital, citing medical negligence, and directed the suspension of OPD and emergency services. A case was also registered against 4 employees of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital for negligence. On Wednesday (4th October), the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court put the order of the district administration on hold and directed the resumption of services.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The video which quickly went viral showed a person resembling cricket legend Kapil Dev, who had his hands tied and mouth strapped being manhandled and taken away by two goons. Cricketer turned politician Gautam Gambhir shared the clip on X, formally Twitter as he enquired about the World Cup-winning captain’s well-being. However, as soon as the video went viral, netizens started flooding Gautam Gambhir’s timeline hoping that it was a promotional stunt similar to what happened last year with cricket pundit Harsha Bhogle.Sharing the video Gautam Gambhir wrote, “Anyone else received this clip, too? Hope it’s not actually @therealkapildev and that Kapil Paaji is fine!” along with a fingers-crossed emoji.Anyone else received this clip, too?

Hopefully it is They did this earlier with Harsha too.A similar video that had left Netizens worrying, had emerged in March 2022, wherein cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle suddenly disappeared while talking to a sports portal via video link. Harsha Bhogle was talking to cricketsportwalkin on an Instagram live session on March 24, 2022, when suddenly he disappeared from the screen after the camera apparently fell to the ground with a blurry image.

""Let's not divide colors on the basis of religion.. sometimes it happens in India also. This saree does not signify any support to any side,"" she said. On Thursday (18th October), journalist Shreya Dhoundial on the Mirror Now channel was slammed by an Israeli guest in an ongoing debate for wearing clothes that allegedly showed the colors of the Palestine flag. Shreya, who is an Executive Editor for Mirror Now, was seen wearing a Green silk saree with a red border and a black blouse. The Israeli official invited for a live debate highlighted that the journalist was wearing the colors of the Palestine flag, indirectly extending support to Hamas terrorists. The video of the incident was shared by the journalist on Twitter (X), who said that her ‘grandmother’s old saree’ had upset the Israeli guest during the live debate. “My Dear Departed Grandmother’s Saree Upset My Guest From Israel This Evening. For Once I Was At A Loss Of Words,” she tweeted. My Dear Departed Grandmother's Saree Upset My Guest From #Israel This Evening. For Once I Was At A Loss Of Words. 👇 pic.twitter.com/uxaEWiqUzaThe Israeli official from the Israel Intel special forces identified as Fredric Landau slammed the journalist and said that she was deliberately wearing the saree to extend support to the terrorist organization from Palestine. “And I can see the colors that you are wearing this evening and that’s why I am purposely wearing blue and white. Because with all due respect, the green, the red, and the black which you are purposely wearing this evening, blue and white will always prevail,” Landau said. Shreya Dhoundiyal responded to the ‘allegation’ by saying that the saree she was wearing belonged to her grandmother and that she had not worn it deliberately. “Let’s not divide colors on the basis of religion.. sometimes it happens in India also. This saree does not signify any support to any side,” she said. However, Landau shut her up by indicating that she should stop making stories. “Save it for identification,” he could be heard saying.It is notable here that the Palestinian flag has the colors black, white, and green in strips, and a red triangle. Shreya was wearing a silk saree with green and red colours with a black blouse. The video of the incident has gone viral over social media with netizens also ‘alleging’ that the journalist was wearing the saree deliberately. One of the users said very conveniently the journalist had bought the colors matching the flag of Palestine. Meanwhile, the other one said, “What a coincidence! Your dear departed grandmother’s sari is just like the flag of the guests’ enemy.” Another user further criticized Dhoundiyal for not doing research on the guest before the debate. “Little research would have saved you from loss of words. As a journalist, research on the subject and interviewer is basic stuff. Either research was not done or it was actually done and a specific dress was worn to give a subtle message. Nowadays, interviewers do research on journalists and they are well prepared to call it out,” he said. On the other hand, many others, including Alt News co-founder Mohammed Zubair, Rohini Singh extended support to Shreya Dhoundial for wearing the saree with colors green, red, and black on it. Zubair shared one of Shreya’s old tweets in which she could be seen wearing a similar saree. However, the colors wore then by her in her attire included Purple, Red, and Green and not Black, Red, and Green which are the colors used in the flag of Palestine. Fact Check : https://t.co/7QT1OqKLxIThe ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine marks the most devastating single incident with the terrorist organization Hamas attacking the Jewish state on 7th October and massacring at least 1,300 people.Updating about the Israel-Hamas war, the Israeli military said on 16th October that it has notified the families of 199 people so far that their loved ones are among those who have been held hostages in the Gaza Strip after they were abducted by Hamas terrorists during the 7th October terror attack. The Iranian Foreign Ministry claimed that Hamas ‘potentially’ was ready to release the nearly 200 Israeli and other foreign nationals it has held hostage if Israel stops airstrikes on the Gaza Strip, the Times of Israel reported. However, the terrorist group, Hamas hasn’t acknowledged making such an offer.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

In this story, The New York Times called Hamas ‘terrorists’. However, it replaced the word ‘terrorists’ with ‘gunmen’ after some time, in line with the left-liberal media policy of not using the term terrorist for jihadi terrorists.The news article titled ‘Hamas Leaves Trail of Terror in Israel’ was published on 10th October by The New York Times. In the subtitle of the article, the American newspaper wrote, “As Israeli soldiers regain control of areas near Gaza that came under attack, they are finding evidence seen in videos and photos and confirmed by witness accounts of the massacre of civilians by Hamas terrorists.”After some time, The New York Times changed the last word in the sentence ‘terrorist’ to ‘gunmen’. The NYT was called out on social media for calling terrorists just gunmen in order to score Islamoapologetic secular credentials. American journalist Greg Price wrote, “Holy shit you can’t make this up. The New York Times published a story referring to Hamas as “terrorists” and then changed it to “gunmen”.” Greg Price also shared the screenshots of the news before and after the change.The archive of the report shows the term ‘terrorist’ used by NYT before it was replaced.🚨Holy shit you can’t make this up.The New York Times published a story referring to Hamas as “terrorists” and then changed it to “gunmen.” pic.twitter.com/zp7vQUrHn3Interestingly, while the original report used the term ‘terrorist’ in the subtitle, it was used only once in the report, while the word ‘gunmen’ was used throughout the report. The publication has not replaced the lone occurrence of the term terrorist in the report, which appears in the second paragraph. The word ‘gunmen’ appears 8 times in the report text, sometimes called ‘Palestinian gunmen’ or ‘Hamas gunmen’. There is no mention in the report that Hamas also fired over 5,000 rockets into Israel, many of which hit civilian areas after overwhelming Israel’s air defence system Iron Dome.Referring to the 9/11 terrorist attack in the USA, Greg Price also wrote, “Untold pain suffering was caused by the amateur pilots on 9/11.”Untold pain suffering was caused by the amateur pilots on 9/11.Another X user with handle ID @WithRitesh posted, “Learning from their brothers across Atlantic!

It has repeatedly provided a platform for Islamic bigotry. In April 2021, NYT published a news article that said that the onus to convert is on non-Muslims in case of an interfaith marriage involving a Muslim and a non-Muslim.The New York Times is also notorious for its anti-India anti-Modi agenda. In March 2023, the New York Times published an article written by Anuradha Bhasin, the Executive Editor of The Kashmir Times who criticized PM Modi’s stance against the Indian media and its freedom of expression. Donning an anti-India outlook on the international media platform, she alleged that the Modi-led government had imposed ‘repressive’ media policies in the country and was deliberately targeting the media organizations who chose to voice an opinion against it or the Prime Minister.The Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Youth Affairs, and Sports Anurag Thakur lashed out at the New York Times for this anti-India editorial published on 8th March 2023. Anurag Thakur had said, “We don’t need to learn the grammar of democracy from agenda-driven media.” Now, The New York Times has called the Hamas terrorists as gunmen. The recent Israel-Hamas war started after the State of Israel came under attack by Palestine-based Islamic terror outfit Hamas on Saturday (7th October), resulting in the death of more than 900 Israelis. About 2400 people have been wounded and over 100 still remain in the captivity of the terrorists. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

17,"10 October, 2023 ","Can Israel be a victim when all countries are supporting it: YouTuber Ravish Kumar downplays Hamas terror attack, floats conspiracy theory","Ravish Kumar inquired, “Are these Western nations doing justice (by siding with Israel) or amplifying terror (of Israel) in the name of combating terrorism?”Two days after Hamas launched a terror attack on the State of Israel and killed 800 civilians in the process, Indian YouTuber Ravish Kumar on Monday (9th October) attempted to paint Hamas as the victim.“Whose terrorism should be condemned? Who is the terrorist in this case? There is another question – Who is the victim?”, he resorted to shielding the Palestine-based Islamist terror organisation Hamas.The former NDTV ‘journalist’ suggested that Israel could not be a victim of terror in the ongoing conflict as several powerful Western nations are supporting the Jewish State. Ravish shamelessly defends Hamas TerroristsAsks who is Real Terrorist- Hamas or Israel?Attacks countries supporting Israel of siding with Terrorists.""हमास और इज़राइल में किसके आतंकवाद की निंदा होनी चाहिए?”""बड़े देश शक्तिशाली इज़राइल का समर्थन कर आतंक का साथ दे रहे हैं” pic.twitter.com/F4bauFaBN8“We have seen an interesting nomenclature in several writings – one is being called a victim (aka Palestine) and another is dubbed as the victim of victims (aka Israel)… Both of them are accused of terrorism and both are victims…Powerful Israel, accused of occupation (in Gaza) is also a victim,” Ravish Kumar claimed. The former ‘scribe’ made a case for Hamas by claiming that the terror organisation in Palestine is not as ‘powerful’ as Israel. “Now imagine the flight of those who are weak (in front of Israel)…Most nations are with Israel and it is still the victim of ‘victims.’ Not even a handful of countries are with Palestine,” he brazened out.In a bid to pacify his large follower base of Hamas sympathisers, Ravish Kumar inquired, “Are these countries doing justice (by siding with Israel) or amplifying terror (of Israel) in the name of combating terrorism?”“एक महीना पहले, नेतन्याहू को जनता का समर्थन नहीं था।सवाल पूछा जाना चाहिए कि हमास अंदर कैसे आ गया, और इसका जवाब इज़राइल के जवाब में मिलेगा”रवीश घूमा-फिरा के बता रहे हैं कि हमला करवा कर नेतन्याहू अपनी सरकार बचा रहे।सिर्फ रवीश ऐसी घटिया सोच रख सकता। pic.twitter.com/1oWiFlBb0RLater in his monologue, the YouTuber insinuated that the Benjamin Netanyahu-led Israeli government orchestrated the attacks on its citizens for political mileage. “Even a month ago, Netanyahu did not have this level of popular support…Should we leave this question out as to how Hamas intruded into the border of Israel? I am sure the answer to this question…” he cast aspersions on Israel instead of questioning Hamas terrorists.Ravish Kumar made the contentious remarks during his 39-minute-long rant on his YouTube channel on Monday (9th October).Similar claims were earlier peddled by ‘journalist’ turned politician Prashant Kanojia, who alleged, “Elections in Israel are going to take place soon. The current Israeli Prime Minister is also a coward like the Prime Minister of another nation. He also wants to attack his own citizens and win elections.”This is not the first time that Ravish Kumar has resorted to whitewashing extremists, responsible for widespread violence. In August 2020, he tried to absolve the radical Islamists of their complicity in the Bengaluru riots.In his usual sober voice, which helps propaganda sound seamlessly soothing, Ravish claimed on Friday, “Jo dangai hota hai vo dangai hota hai. Na toh unha Hindu mazhab see koi matlab hota hai na hi koi Muslim mazhab see koi matlab hota hai (A rioter is a rioter. He has nothing to due with Hindusim or Islam.)”Ravish further claimed, “Rioters look for a reason to be provoked. Those who know this game plan are well acquainted with the fact that a post can attract mobs who will unleash.” Through his claims, Ravish tried to deny the ‘communal angle’ in the Bengaluru carnage. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

18,"9 October, 2023 ","Former Indian Express journalist Irena Akbar floats conspiracy theory, claims that deceased Shani Louk wore bikini and was not stripped by Hamas terrorists","It could be possible that when she was killed, she was wearing a bikini or other skin-exposing garment,"" the former Indian Express 'journalist' said.A day after Hamas terrorists stripped a German woman and paraded her dead body on a pickup truck, former Indian Express ‘journalist‘ Irena Akbar came out in defence of the terrorists on Sunday (8th October) morning.In a tweet, she wrote, “The woman, whose body was being taken in a pick-up truck, has been identified as Shani Louk, a German-Israeli dual citizen who was reportedly attending a music festival. First, this is NOT an etiquette of war in Islam to attack women, and hence this is condemnable.”The ex-scribe put out a token condemnation over the death of Louk only because ‘attacking women during war’ is supposedly against the tenets of Islam. Then, she proceeded to suggest that the victim was not stripped as she was not ‘fully naked.’One would have to suspend disbelief to believe what this woman is defending here. But, it is par for the course. Don’t underestimate the cruelty of the women of the barbaric cult. They are assigned various roles. One is the defence of a murder, the other is grooming in the… pic.twitter.com/ig50LljpwI“The woman is not fully naked, as parts of her upper & lower body are covered. If you check the Instagram account of Shani Louk (@shanukkk), you would see pictures she posted of herself wearing bikins or other skin-exposing outfits,” Irena Akbar brazened it out.She claimed that the victim could have been ‘partially naked’ at the time of her killing and not necessarily stripped by Hamas terrorists. “It could be possible that when she was killed, she was wearing a bikini or other skin-exposing garment,” the former Indian Express ‘journalist’ said.“…I am being factual here, based on evidence from her own Instagram account where she would post pictures of herself in such clothes. So, it cannot be ruled out that Shani (with all due respect to her) was wearing a bikini or other similar garment when she was killed or captured,” she further alleged.Irena Akbar wrote, “And hence, it is possible that she was NOT stripped by the Hamas militants. However, as Islam prescribes modesty for women and men, and respect for the dead, the militants should have covered her body with a cloth or sheet, and treated it respectfully, or not attack her at all.”She then resorted to mental gymnastics and asked why people, who hail bikinis as a symbol of ‘freedom’, are raising concerns about seeing a woman’s uncovered body. The ex- Indian Express ‘journalist’ conveniently glossed over the fact that the victim was murdered, stripped and paraded by Hamas terrorists.“So, let’s be fair before jumping to outrage, or celebration. Also, I have a question for non- Muslims: You often share pictures of bikini- clad Iranian women on beaches before the Islamic Revolution of 1979. You lament that the women were “free and liberated” in Iran before Shariah law was adopted,” Akbar remarked.“You use the bikini as a symbol of freedom and liberation for Muslim women of Iran, and you contrast that with the hijab, a symbol of “oppression” under Iran’s mandatory hijab law. So, why do you have a problem when Shani Louk was possibly wearing a bikini (when she was sadly captured)?” she brazened out.“Why do you have a problem when her almost-naked body could be publicly seen? Are you again using a woman’s uncovered body to make a point against Palestinians, and Muslims?” the former ‘scribe’ concluded.In April 2021, Irena Akbar stirred the hornet’s nest by thanking Allah for the Coronavirus pandemic. She claimed “If it weren’t for Covid, Indian Muslims would’ve been in detention camps. I’m NOT being grateful for the virus which killed my aunt, sent my dad to the ICU & is causing tragedies across homes. I’m stressing the fact that while fascists were making their plans, God was making His.”“It’s between the devil & the deep blue sea for IMs. Either die/live in fear of Covid OR die/live in fear of anti-Muslim state violence. At least the former doesn’t specifically target us & the public will eventually question the state. But in latter, the public would rejoice it,” she added.In February 2020, she asserted that Dalits should never be trusted by the Muslim community. The Islamist claimed that the Dalits were the ‘foot soldiers’ when communal riots broke out in Gujarat in 2002 after a Muslim mob engineered the Godhra train carnage.“They did the dirty job of gang-raping and killing Muslims. I have never trusted them. They are ill-treated by their upper-caste Hindu brothers, not by Muslims. We owe them nothing,” she wrote. Irena Akbar also called for boycotts of business establishments run by Hindus. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

19,"19 October, 2023 ",Ram Mandir: 51-inch Balswaroop idol to be handed over to the Temple trust by 31st October,"The Ram Lalla idols are being made based on the sketch of internationally acclaimed artist Vasudeo Kamath. He hails from Karnataka’s Karkala town and his paintings from the Ramayana series are acclaimed worldwide.The decades-long wait of Hindu devotees is going to end in January 2024. The construction work of the Bhavya Ram Mandir at Ram Janmabhoomi is progressing rapidly. In May, the Ram Janmabhoomi temple trust announced that three sculptors are making the Ram Lalla statue to be placed in the Garbhagriha. A member of one of the three teams, Vipin Bhadouriya recently informed that the 51-inch tall Balswaroop idol will be handed over to the Ram Janmabhoomi Temple trust by 31st October. Bhadouriya asserted, “The statue of Ramlalla, which will be placed in the sanctum sanctorum of Ayodhya’s Ram temple, is almost complete and will be handed over to the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust by 31st October.” Bhadouriya has been working around the clock with his mentor, Ganesh Bhatt, who is an eminent sculptor from Karnataka. Regarding Ramlalla’s idol, Bhadouriya noted, “Our idol made of black stone will be the world’s most beautiful statue of Lord Ram, more beautiful than what was imagined. The beauty of the idol would leave people mesmerised.” He further highlighted that the idol depicts a balswaroop Ram, as a five-year-old, standing on a lotus, carrying a bow in one hand and an arrow in the other. Additionally, the statue would also have fine carvings and designs. All signs related to Lord Ram are carved on the statue which will be 51 inches tall.Bhadouriya added, “I am happy that our efforts have yielded some good results. Our work is on the verge of completion. After some finishing touches, the idol will be handed over to the trust by the end of this month.” However, he is not the only one who is preparing the Ram Lalla idol. In May, General Secretary Champat Rai said, “The construction work of the idol of Ram Lalla has started. Dr Ganesh Bhatt from Karnataka, Satya Narayan Pandey from Jaipur, and Arun Yogiraj from Karnataka are making idols at three different places on three different stones.” #WATCH | Ayodhya, UP: The construction work of the idol of Ram Lalla has started. Dr Ganesh Bhatt from Karnataka, Satya Narayan Pandey from Jaipur, and Arun Yogiraj from Karnataka are making idols at three different places on three different stones. It is expected that the idol… pic.twitter.com/0PBCgjXbP0According to the Trust officials, the finest Ram Lalla idol would be placed in the ‘garbhagriha’, while the remaining two would be placed in another temple. The Ram Lalla idols are being made based on the sketch of internationally acclaimed artist Vasudeo Kamath. He hails from Karnataka’s Karkala town and his paintings from the Ramayana series are acclaimed worldwide.Meanwhile, out of the three sculptors, two — Bhadouriya and his mentor Bhatt, and Arun Yogiraj from Mysore – have used ‘Krishna Shila’ (black stone) from Karnataka to carve the Ram Lalla idol. Krishna Shila is found in the vicinity of Karkala, a small town in Karnataka, approximately 60 kilometers away from Mangalore.According to the officials, the most attractive and durable sculptures are made with Krishna Shila as it is one of the finest stones used for sculpting. A trust official said, “The stone, weighing 10 tonnes, 6 feet wide, 4 feet thick, and almost one foot long, was specially brought from Nellikaru village in Karkala, almost a month ago.” Whereas the third team comprising Satya Narayan Pandey and his son Shilpi from Jaipur is carving the Ram Lalla statue from ‘A-class’ stone or marble from Makrana. Regarding the usage of Makrana marble, Officials said, “Makrana marble is used for its durability, translucency and fine grains. It is ‘weatherproof’, as it is resistant to erosion and weathering, which makes it ideal for outdoor sculptures and statues.”However, it is important to note that the trust is not using the two Shaligram stones, weighing 14 and 26 tonnes, which arrived from Nepal on 2nd January, for the construction of the Ram Lalla idol.Regarding this Champat Rai said, “The two Devshilas were gifted to us by Nepal. These stones were calcite and quartzite and were procured from the Gandaki River in the Muktinath area of the Himalayan region. However, after consulting many seers, priests, and experts, the trust decided not to use the Devshila from Nepal. It was a difficult decision to take.” The trust has not yet finalised what will be done with Devshila.Further, the Ram Janmabhoomi Trust officials also elaborated on the procedure that will be followed prior to the consecration (pran pratishtha) ceremony of the idol, in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi would take part, on 22nd January.According to the officials, a grand procession will be taken out through the streets of Ayodhya and the Ram Lalla idol will be placed on a special chariot that is under construction. The trust officials said, “The scholars from Kashi will worship River Saryu and give a holy dip to the idol amid the chants of special mantras and hymns. On the final day, the idol will be installed in the garbhagriha.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

He had reached the Sharda Mata Mandir along with his followers on Rath Yatra from Kishkinda – the birthplace of Lord Hanuman in Karnataka.On 15th October (Sunday), the Sharad Navratri Puja was performed at the newly constructed Sharda Temple which is located in the Teetwal border region of North Kashmir’s Kupwara district, near the Line of Control (LoC). Devotees in large numbers from far-flung areas attended the Navratri Puja as it was for the first time after partition that the Navratri Pujas were held in the Sharda Temple in Kashmir. Taking to X, Union Home Minister Amit Shah asserted that the development has a profound spiritual significance noting that the puja rituals were held for the first time since 1947 in the Sharda Temple in Kashmir. He noted that he was fortunate to inaugurate Mata Sharda Temple in March 2023.  Home Minister Shah tweeted, “It is a matter of profound spiritual significance that for the first time since 1947, the Navratri pujas have been held in the historic Sharda Temple in Kashmir this year. Earlier in the year the Chaitra Navratri Puja was observed and now the mantras of the Shardiya Navratri puja resound in the shrine.

He had reached the Sharda Mata Mandir along with his followers on Rath Yatra from Kishkinda – the birthplace of Lord Hanuman in Karnataka.Several prominent Kashmiri Pandit pilgrims, including AK Raina, a renowned theatre personality who had acted in the acclaimed film “The Kashmir Files” were also part of the ritual ceremony. Notably, the Teetwal area originally had Sharda Mata Mandir and Gurudwara but they were destroyed during the tribal raids of 1947. Recently, a new Mandir and Gurudwara were constructed in the same architectural style and on the same sacred land. It was later inaugurated on March 23 of this year by Union Home Minister Amit Shah. Subsequently, the doors of the Mata Sharda Devi Mandir were opened for devotees on the first day of Chaitra Navratri, this year.Regarding this, the Head of Save Sharda Committee Kashmir, Ravinder Pandita said, “It was yet again a historical moment to perform Navratri puja at Sharda temple LoC, for the first time after partition. The temple and Gurudwara that used to exist here were burnt down in tribal raids in 1947 and a new temple and gurudwara has come up on the same piece of land on the same pattern, that was inaugurated by Union Home Minister Amit Shah on 23 March, this year.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

21,"15 October, 2023 ","Navratri: Festival of women’s power whose religious, cultural, economic and scientific aspects are equally important, read the significance of Garba","Garba is viewed as a representation of the universe and the 27 pores (9 in 3 lines) are interpreted as a depiction of the 27 constellations and each of them has 4 phases through which the number 27 X 4 = 108 is obtained.India is a wonderful country where all occasions and festivals are observed with grandeur. Diverse folk traditions are seen from different regions in this colourful country. The sophisticated and magnificent culture of affluent India is formed through the fusion of many indigenous customs. Sanatana Dharma’s core principle is that we are able to gain fresh knowledge throughout our festivities which offer a rational perspective as well and Navratri is one such event which falls on 15 October of this year. Let us tell you about Navratri’s cultural, religious and scientific significance and explain why it is known as the celebration of women’s power.Cultural and religious significance of NavratriNavratri has a special significance across the country, especially in Gujarat. The worshippers of Goddess Shakti observe a nine-day fast and play Garba during the nights. Many consider Garba as a form of entertainment which is performed for fun, however, that is not the case. Navratri has a special significance in spiritualism and is dedicated to the worship of Goddess Parashakti. It is not for enjoying and doing Garba and Dandiya only. Garba is but one method of worshipping Goddess Shakti and growing closer to her. The importance of dance has been described in the ancient Vedic tradition. There are numerous paths that lead to God and Garba is one of them. Therefore, it is first and foremost important to understand and accept that the Ras-Garba on Navratri is not just for leisure, but a vital component of our religious and cultural history.Religious history states that a demon by the name of Mahishasura once sat to perform penance for Lord Brahma. He demanded to be immortal after the latter was pleased and told him to ask for a blessing. However, he was directed to seek another one because immortality was against the law of nature. Afterwards, he requested a boon that neither a god nor a demon or a human could kill him and only a woman would be able to end his life which was granted.Mahishasura rose to power over time and eventually began waging war against the gods who fought unitedly against him but were unable to put a halt to his reign of terror after which Lord Shiv and Lord Vishnu were pleaded for assistance. However, it was not possible to defeat the demon because of the boon bestowed upon him. As a result, all of them including Lord Vishnu began to call upon Goddess Adishakti and a heavenly light that emanated from their bodies gave her a physical form.Mahishasura and Goddess Shakti engaged in combat despite the fact that he was destined to die at her hands. The war lasted for nine days and she defeated him on the tenth day and the festival of Navaratri came into existence ever since. Vijayadashami is commemorated after the conclusion of the auspicious nine days to mark the day the ferocious demon was eliminated. Notably, the day is also celebrated as Dussehra because Lord Ram killed demon king Ravan on the same day. Vijayadashami is an observance of the triumph of Dharma over evil.Scientific RelevanceThe scientific value of Navratri is linked to both its religious and cultural significance. The festival coincides with the intersection of two seasons which has scientific merit. There is a sandhikaal (end of one season and beginning of another) during both Navratris of the year. The body’s adjustment to speech, phlegm and bile generally goes through phases of improvement and decline during this time which affects the immune system. This is the reason that nine days are dedicated to chanting, fasting, purification of the body, cleaning, meditation, havan and other practices to prevent multiple illnesses and have a clean environment.Economic ImportanceAnother very significant aspect of Navratri is its fiscal impact. Hindu events also have a substantial economic component. The income of those who create garba and diyas (clay Lamps) begins to rise at the start of Navratri. Garba is a celebration of the festival of goddess that is participated in by all devotees and it provides employment to the people who make earthen pots and lamps.Moreover, the way people dress traditionally during Navratri is also crucial and benefits those who create the outfits. Several people find work through both little and large purchases. People who produce or sell snacks, sweets, fruits and religious items, for instance, have considerable possibilities for work during Navratri. Therefore, it is equally important to take into account the financial implications of the festival.Importance of ‘Women Power’The significance of women power outweighs the religious, cultural and monetary worth of Navratri by multiple factors. Adishakti pervades the atom and governs the whole universe. Feminity or power of women is also a component of the goddess. A person’s strength is their potential and no work is possible without shakti (power) which is of unique importance in the entire world. Hence, it is worshipped in different places in various ways. It’s recognised as power energy by science. It is known as Shakti or even divine energy in the ancient Vedic faith. According to the Rig Veda, the universe in its entirety originated with a singular power and per science the universe is composed of one energy. The power of women brought prominence to the world just as the universe has emerged from the primal power. Therefore, women power is regarded as an expression of Adishakti.Navratri also serves as a celebration of female empowerment. Navratri is also considered dedicated to women power. Girls are worshipped on the day of Durgashtami and Mahanavami on the occasion of Navratri as they are considered to be the form of Goddess Durga. There is a custom of worshipping one to nine girls between the ages of 2 years to 10 years during the festival.The entire cosmos could not have been created without Goddess Durga who is nature and divinity. She is oxygen and completes Lord Shiva. Shiva and Shakti come together to form Ardhanarishvar (lord who is half feminine). Since Navratri is dedicated to women power and respects them. The fast and Durga Puja would be futile if one offends his mother, sister, wife, daughter or another female during this festival. Hence, Navratri imparts the essential message of honouring all women.Significance of GarbaThe word Garba is derived from the Sanskrit word ‘Garbhdeep’. The popularity of playing garba among young people has elevated significantly in recent times. The popularity of playing garba among young people has elevated tremendously in recent times. If we look at the intriguing background of this well-known and fascinating folk dance, we discover that doing Garba was formerly only a tradition in Rajasthan and Gujarat (notably Saurashtra and Kutch). However, it gained popularity and spread to other parts of India. Now, people take part in Garba all around the country. Garba programs are organised in temples and houses. Nine holes are punched into Garba and it is placed in the centre and everyone plays Raas-Garba around it. Nowadays, large Garba festivals are hosted by various organisations in which people participate.The holes represent the shape of the human body while the lamp therein symbolises the flame form of the soul. The former indicates the nine doors of the human body which include the two eyes, two ears, two noses (nostrils), mouth, anus and genitalia. A person’s soul exits their body through any of these openings when they die. A lamp is continuously lit for nine days with the conviction that the self-flame is perpetually ignited.Apart from this, 27 holes are made in Garba in many places, however, the mystery of it is unknown. Garba is viewed as a representation of the universe and the 27 pores (9 in 3 lines) are interpreted as a depiction of the 27 constellations and each of them has 4 phases through which the number 27 X 4 = 108 is obtained. Therefore, it is believed that rotating the Garbi 108 times by placing the Garba in the middle is equal to the virtue of circumambulating the universe.Method and tradition of worshipNine forms of Goddess Durga are worshipped during Navratri. Each day is dedicated to the worship of a different form. The nine manifestations of the goddess are Shailputri, Brahmacharini, Chandraghanta, Kushmanda, Skanda Mata, Katyayani, Kalratri, Maha Gauri and Siddhidatri. Goddess Durga along with her family, based on religious beliefs, rode her Vahan (carrier/vehicle) from Kailash to Earth on the first day of Navratri. It is crucial to invoke the goddess during the Navratri fast. Invocation means inviting the deity into the house for a specific goal or accomplishment. The installation of the Kumbhasthapana or Kalash comes first in the procedure of worshipping Goddess Shakti. It must be installed if one fast for nine days during Navratri and should do the same even on the first or the day of Ashtami. According to the Devi Purana, it is very important to establish a Kalash in the house before worshipping Goddess Bhagavati. It is erected during worship as an image of the goddess’s strength and as a site of pilgrimage. The Kalash is viewed as a representation of wealth, joy and elegance. Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, Lord Shiva and the heavenly mother force all reside in it.The worship of Goddess Shakti can take place in multiple ways and there are numerous methods to do it which comprise yajna-yagya (ritual done in front of a sacred fire), havan (sacred purification ritual), vrat (fast), japa (meditative repetition of a mantra or a divine name), tapa (asceticism, spiritual discipline) and dhyana (meditation) among other things are performed. Chandipath, BhavanyaShtakam and Shakradaya Stuti have a very special significance in Navratri. Yajna is carried out during Navratri at any divine religious place. It is a method in the Vedic tradition that displays a profound mysticism and the culmination of spiritual power.Note: Read the report in Gujarati here.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

23,"20 October, 2023 ","‘Samdhi, bhai, and the jilted ex’: Know what Mahua Moitra is alluding to in her statement that brings a ‘saas-bahu’ style drama to the whole affair"," Cyril Shroff is the Samdhi of Gautam Adani, and Shardul Shroff, who is accused of giving unverified allegations against Adani to Mahua Moitram, is the bhai or brother of Cyril ShroffDays after BJP MP Nishikant Dubey wrote to the Lok Sabha speaker seeking a probe against TMC MP Mahua Moitra accusing her of taking luxury gifts for asking questions in Lok Sabha, things have rapidly escalated for the West Bengal politician. First, it was revealed that Dupey’s allegations were based on information provided to him by advocate Jai Anant Dehadrai, former partner of Mohua Moitra.After that, the statement by Dehadrai appeared in public, giving detailed accounts of the allegations against Moitra. He said that Mahua Moitra received expensive gifts and other benefits from business tycoon Darshan Hiranandani, in exchange for asking questions in parliament targeting Gautam Adani, Hiranandani’s business rival in several sectors.It was also alleged that Mahua Moitra had provided her Lok Sabha portal’s login credentials, allowing him to post questions directly on her behalf. While the TMC MP had denied the charges, things exploded on 19 October, when Darshan Hiranandani himself issued a statement, confirming the allegations. He confirmed that he was given Mahua Moitra’s Parliament login and password to post questions. Hiranandani also confirmed that he had given luxury gifts to Moitra, paid for her holidays and travels, helped her in renovating her house etc.The real estate tycoon said that Mohua Moitra chose to target Gautam Adani to attack Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as there was nothing to target the PM directly. Adding to the allegations, Darshan Hiranandani alleged that Mahua Moitra was getting unverified information from several people to target Adani. He specifically mentioned three names, Sucheta Dalal, Shardul Shroff and Pallavi Shroff. Here, Sucheta Dalal is a well-known journalist, while Shardul Shroff and Pallavi Shroff are advocates.Mahua Moitra has issued a statement in response to Hiranandani’s statement, alleging that he was forced to issue the statement by putting a gun to his head. However, she didn’t refute charges that she had given him her Lok Sabha login ID and password and also didn’t deny getting gifts from him and asking questions based on his inputs. She added that Cyril Shroff, brother of Shadul Shoff mentioned by Hiranandani, is the Samdhi of Gautam Adani, and the two brothers had a bitter separation of the business. Before mentioning this Samdhi and his Bhai (brother), Moitra had also mentioned her ‘jilted-ex’. Here are the concerned persons and their links to the entire story.Shardul Shroff and Pallavi Shroff are lawyers, and they run one of the largest law firms in India, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co. Shardul Shroff is the Executive Chairman and his wife Pallavi Shroff is the Managing Partner of the law firm, and interestingly, they have an Adani connection. Especially, they were in a bitter fight with Shardul’s brother over the law firm, and that brother is a relative of Gautam Adani.Shardul Shroff and his brother Cyril Shroff were managing partners of Amarchand Mangaldas & Suresh A Shroff & Co, a top law firm. However, there was a rivalry between the two brothers over the firm, and they decided in 2015 to split the company. They reached a settlement following mediation and decided that they would split the law firm established in 1917 by their grandfather.The dispute was the result of the will by their mother Bharati Shroff, who had handed over her entire share in the law firm to Shardul Shroff. Shardul Shroff had moved the Delhi High Court seeking implementation of the will, triggering a bitter war between the brothers.However, they finally decided to settle the matter by signing a Family Framework Agreement. According to this agreement, the shares of their mother were divided equally between them. As a result of the settlement, Cyril Shroff chose to not contest the implementation of the will, and Shardul Shroff chose to not go ahead with the lawsuit seeking implementation of the will.Accordingly, Shardul Shroff now runs Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co, while Cyril Shroff runs Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, India’s largest full-services law firm. Now that Darshan Hiranandani has accused Shardul Shroff and his wife Pallavi Shroff of helping Mahua Moitra in the campaign against Gautam Adani by feeding unverified information, it becomes interesting to note that Shardul’s brother Cyril is related to Gautam Adani.Paridhi Shroff is the daughter of Cyril Shroff and his lawyer wife Vandana Shroff. Paridhi is married to Karan Adani, the elder son of Gautam Adani. Therefore, Gautam Adani and Cyril Shroff are Samdhis, the Hindi word for fathers of spouses.Karan Adani married Paridhi Shroff in a high-profile wedding ceremony in 2013, which was attended by several well-known guests including Mukesh Ambani and Anand Mahindra. Paridhi Shroff is also a lawyer and is a partner at Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas.Given the proximity of Cyril Shroff’s family with Adani and also with his brother, it is possible that Shardul Shroff and Pallavi Shroff had obtained information about the Adani group through Cyril’s firm, which then they passed on to Mahua Moitra.Hence, there are several people involved in the story involving the ‘gift for questions’ charges against Mahua Moitra. There is Cyril Shroff, the Samdhi of Gautam Adani, and Shardul Shroff, who is the bhai or brother of Cyril Shroff.There is also a ‘jilted-ex’ in the story, who is none other than advocate Jai Anant Dehadrai, who unfolded the entire scam. Mahua Moitra has described him as her ‘jilted ex’, acknowledging their previous relationship. She alleged that the allegations against her were based on lies of a ‘jilted ex’.There is also a dog in the story, named Henry. Apparently, both Mahua Moitra and Jai Anant Dehadrai are claiming ownership of this pet dog. Dehadrai has alleged that he had bought the dog, and now his ex Mahua Moitra has stolen it. He has even written to the Delhi police, seeking to get the Rottweiler dog back from the TMC MP. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

24,"19 October, 2023 ","Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza Strip: Ideology, activities, and role in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict","Hamas' attack on Israel on 7th October 2023 brought both terrorist organisations on their toes as Israel retaliated with full might. Notably, while Hamas led the multifaceted assault on Israel, which included land, sea, and air components, PIJ took an active part in the assault, taking dozens of Israelis hostage.Harakat al-Jihad al-Islami al-Filastini, which is better known as Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) or the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine, is the second-largest terrorist organisation operating in the Palestinian territories. It primarily operates in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. PIJ came into existence in 1981. It represents a later generation of Palestinian terrorist groups. Founded in the Gaza Strip, the primary goal of PIJ was to “liberate historical Palestine” using armed struggle and by “appealing to the Islamic heritage of the region”.PIJ separates itself from the other earlier generations of Palestinian Islamist groups, such as Fatah and Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), as it is mainly influenced by the Islamist ideology of armed liberation rather than internal reform. The founders of PIJ, particularly Fathi-al-Shiqaqi, were linked to the infamous Muslim Brotherhood. Shiqaqi and others believed reviving Islamic rule over the Holy Land of Jerusalem was essential. Other Islamist groups mainly focused on internal reform rather than the so-called armed liberation. Shiqaqi was assassinated in 1995. PIJ stresses the importance of bringing the Islamic front together to “liberate Palestine” and bring Islamic rule back in the region. It generally rejects the legitimacy of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and refuses to participate in the elections held by the PA. Going against the PA’s efforts, PIJ emphasised bringing the Islamic community together while acknowledging the diversity among the Islamic movements, including Sunni, Shi’a, Salafi, and Sufi. While the world leaders have extended support to Palestine via a two-state solution, PIJ has categorically rejected it and insisted the entire historic region of Palestine should be brought back under Islamic Rule.PIJ started to expand its presence in the early 2000s. During 2000-2005, there was a period of heightened unrest between Israel and the Palestinian movement. PIJ established its significant presence in the West Bank in those years with hubs in Jenin and the Gaza Strip. During that time, PIJ became the second most potent terrorist organisation operating in Gaza after Hamas.After Hamas’s takeover and Israel’s blockade, PIJ pushed Hamas to engage in military activities to resist the blockade placed in Gaza. The pressure imposed by PIJ on Hamas was reportedly so intense that Hamas followed suit and indulged in armed conflict with Israeli forces. PIJ proved its importance in the area and managed to have an indirect influence on the public policy of Gaza under the de facto ruler, which was Hamas.In the early 2010s, PIJ expanded its presence into “social services” in Gaza. The aim was to offer an alternative for Hamas to the people of Palestine. PIJ kept running its propaganda under the curtain of becoming the voice of the Palestinians and increased its visibility, challenging the dominance of Hamas in the region. While PIJ and Hamas were sort of rivals for dominance in the region, as time passed by, they formed an unwritten modus vivendi or an agreement of existing together in the region. This was the period when Israel started to notice the increasing dominance of PIJ and attacked it directly.Israel and the United States both consider Hamas and PIJ terrorist organisations. They both share a common ground when it comes to acting against Israel. There is ample evidence that the two terrorist organisations have collaborated and launched joint operations to coordinate military activities in Gaza. However, there have been reports that they often lock horns, especially when there are calls for de-escalation in conflict with Israel.The United States and Israel have designated PIJ as a terrorist organisation due to its violent tactics and objectives in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. These designations have implications for regional cooperation.PIJ is mainly backed by Iran, which has provided significant funding and weapons to the terrorist organisation, making it an instrument of Iranian policy in the Arab-Israeli conflict. The financial support from Iran has fluctuated over the years, influenced by the PIJ’s willingness to align with Iran’s broader regional interests. Apart from Iran, it also gets support from Syria and the Lebanese terrorist organisation Hezbollah. Tensions between PIJ and Israel have escalated from time to time over the years. There have been several rocket attacks and airstrikes, leading to violent cycles and casualties on both sides. PIJ’s emphasis on military confrontations and its association with Iran have contributed to its clashes with Israel.Palestinian terrorist groups, including PIJ, have been known to launch rocket attacks that sometimes result in harm to civilians and property. Such incidents underscore the challenges and complexities of asymmetric conflicts where innocent civilians are often caught in the crossfire. It is in sync with the latest incident where a malfunctioned rocket fell on a hospital in Gaza.In recent times, Hamas’s attack on Israel on 7th October 2023 brought both terrorist organisations on their toes as Israel retaliated with full might. Notably, while Hamas led the multifaceted assault on Israel, which included land, sea, and air components, PIJ took an active part in the assault, taking dozens of Israelis hostage. The coordination between the two terrorist organisations showed the evolving dynamics of their military aspects and ability to launch attacks inside Israeli territory. Israel and Hamas war entered the 12th day on 19th October. On 17th October, a rocket fell on the Al-Ahli al-Arabi Hospital in Gaza. The local media working in Gaza ran reports based on Hamas’ claims that it was an Israeli rocket and around 500 people died in it. However, as more information came to light, it was clear that the hospital’s parking lot took the hit, and the hospital building was mostly intact. Furthermore, it was revealed that the rocket that fell on the hospital was not shot by Israel but by PIJ, putting the terrorist organisation in the spotlight across mainstream media.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

25,"17 October, 2023 ","High Court allows Raghav Chadha’s petition to review expulsion from his bungalow, asks him to file an application with the city court","Contrary to Chadha's claim, while the court has vacated the April 18 order which directed the Rajya Sabha secretariat not to evict suspended MP Raghav Chadha from the bungalow in question, it does not imply that the AAP MP is innocent or that there was no violation of the rules pertaining to the allotment of official residence to MPs by the House CommitteeOn Tuesday, 17th October, the Delhi High Court allowed Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MP Raghav Chadha’s plea challenging the trial court’s order allowing the Rajya Sabha secretariat to evict Chadha from a Type VII bungalow in New Delhi.Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani stated on Tuesday that the trial court’s April 18 ruling which ordered the Rajya Sabha Secretariat not to evict Chadha stands reinstated. The order, however, stands revived only till the adjudication of Raghav Chadha’s plea seeking a temporary injunction against his eviction from the Type VII bungalow.The court has ordered Raghav Chadha to file an application for temporary relief with the city court within three days and has ordered the trial court to rule on it first in accordance with the law. The court directed the trial court to decide on Chadha’s plea under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 of the Civil Procedure Code or Code of Civil Procedure (CPC).“The appeal is allowed. Holding that A) there was no requirement for the appellant to file an application under 80 CPC to comply with that provision thus the application under 80 CPC is disposed of as infructuous. Directing the appellant to be present in the court within three days of the pronouncement of the judgement with the direction to the trial court to first decide the application under Order 39 rules 1 and 2 & thus to proceed in accordance with the law. In the meantime, the order dated 18/4 shall stand revived till the application under Order 39 rules 1 and 2 is decided by the trial court,” the bench said.Notably, Rule 1 of Order 39– Temporary Injunctions and Interlocutory Orders provides that temporary injunction may be granted wherein it is proved through an affidavit or otherwise that “any property in dispute in a suit is in danger of being wasted, damaged or alienated by any party to the suit, or wrongfully sold in execution of a decree, or that the defendant threatens, or intends, to remove or dispose of his property with a view to defrauding his creditors, or that the defendant threatens to dispossess, the plaintiff or otherwise cause injury to the plaintiff in relation to any property in dispute in the suit,” till further orders in the matter or its disposal.Rule 2 of Order 39 allows the court to grant an injunction to restrain the repetition or continuance of breach by the defendant(s).Soon after the court ruling came out, the AAP MP ‘welcomed’ the court’s decision to allow his plea to review expulsion from the Type VII bungalow he occupies as if he had been vindicated.Taking to X, Chadha in his ‘statement’ regarding the court ruling said, “I welcome the decision of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court to set aside the order of the trial court, which was against me. The cancellation of this allotment was a clear case of political vendetta, aimed at silencing a young, vocal parliamentarian.” The MP also said that opposition voices were being “deliberately targeted”.He claimed that this is not a fight for home or shop but to save the Constitution.Ye makan ya dukan ki nahin, Samvidhan ko bachane ki ladhayi haiIn the end, truth and justice have prevailedMy statement on the Hon'ble Delhi High Court's ruling to set aside the unjust order to evict me from my official residence. pic.twitter.com/fA7BJ2zLYmContrary to Chadha’s claim, while the court has vacated the April 18 order which directed the Rajya Sabha secretariat not to evict suspended MP Raghav Chadha from the bungalow in question, it does not imply that the AAP MP is innocent or that there was no violation of the rules pertaining to the allotment of official residence to MPs by the House Committee, on his part. Notably, the AAP MP from Punjab had on 10th October moved to Delhi High Court against a trial court ruling dated 5th October lifting the stay on its prior stay order on his eviction from his government bungalow located in Delhi’s Pandara Road.Additional District Judge Sudhanshu Kaushik had ruled that MP Raghav Chadha is not entitled to the Type VII bungalow which he currently occupies, thus allowing the Rajya Sabha secretariat to undertake the process to evict the AAP MP.Rajya Sabha MP Raghav Chadha was allocated a Type VII bungalow on Pandara Road in Delhi in September 2022. However, the Rajya Sabha Secretariat annulled the allotment in March 2023 since it exceeded his entitlements as a first-time MP. Subsequently, the AAP MP was allotted an alternate residence.Chadha had challenged the order at Patiala House Court and obtained a stay on April 18th. The Rajya Sabha Secretariat later filed an objection to the stay order, saying that it was issued without providing them with an opportunity to be heard. The court heard both sides and removed the stay order on October 5th. However, the Delhi High Court has now granted Raghav Chadha permission to re-appear before the trial court within three days from October 17th.According to the Rajya Sabha Handbook, which specifies the eligibility criteria for accommodation, Rajya Sabha MPs, who are first-time Members of Parliaments, including Raghav Chadha, are entitled to Type V bungalows or single flats as their official residence. It is mentioned in the Rajya Sabha Handbook that the MPs who were former Ministers of State, Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha, Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha, nominated members, floor leaders of their parties and members who have served at least one term are allotted Type VI bungalows or twin flats.Meanwhile, Type VII bungalows are allocated to MPs who have previously served in the Union Cabinet, or as Governors or Chief Ministers, or as Lok Sabha Speakers.Furthermore, the Handbook stipulates that the House Committee chairperson may make exceptions. Chadha’s allocation of a Type VII bungalow required the approval of the chairman of the House Committee.While Chadha’s counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi has argued that out of 245 sitting MPs in the Rajya Sabha, 115 have been granted accommodation above their ‘default’ entitlement, Additional Secretariat General (ASG) Vikramjit Banerjee appearing for Rajya Sabha Secretariat stated that he cannot demand negative equality over possessing government property.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

26,"15 October, 2023 ","Navratri: Festival of women’s power whose religious, cultural, economic and scientific aspects are equally important, read the significance of Garba","Garba is viewed as a representation of the universe and the 27 pores (9 in 3 lines) are interpreted as a depiction of the 27 constellations and each of them has 4 phases through which the number 27 X 4 = 108 is obtained.India is a wonderful country where all occasions and festivals are observed with grandeur. Diverse folk traditions are seen from different regions in this colourful country. The sophisticated and magnificent culture of affluent India is formed through the fusion of many indigenous customs. Sanatana Dharma’s core principle is that we are able to gain fresh knowledge throughout our festivities which offer a rational perspective as well and Navratri is one such event which falls on 15 October of this year. Let us tell you about Navratri’s cultural, religious and scientific significance and explain why it is known as the celebration of women’s power.Cultural and religious significance of NavratriNavratri has a special significance across the country, especially in Gujarat. The worshippers of Goddess Shakti observe a nine-day fast and play Garba during the nights. Many consider Garba as a form of entertainment which is performed for fun, however, that is not the case. Navratri has a special significance in spiritualism and is dedicated to the worship of Goddess Parashakti. It is not for enjoying and doing Garba and Dandiya only. Garba is but one method of worshipping Goddess Shakti and growing closer to her. The importance of dance has been described in the ancient Vedic tradition. There are numerous paths that lead to God and Garba is one of them. Therefore, it is first and foremost important to understand and accept that the Ras-Garba on Navratri is not just for leisure, but a vital component of our religious and cultural history.Religious history states that a demon by the name of Mahishasura once sat to perform penance for Lord Brahma. He demanded to be immortal after the latter was pleased and told him to ask for a blessing. However, he was directed to seek another one because immortality was against the law of nature. Afterwards, he requested a boon that neither a god nor a demon or a human could kill him and only a woman would be able to end his life which was granted.Mahishasura rose to power over time and eventually began waging war against the gods who fought unitedly against him but were unable to put a halt to his reign of terror after which Lord Shiv and Lord Vishnu were pleaded for assistance. However, it was not possible to defeat the demon because of the boon bestowed upon him. As a result, all of them including Lord Vishnu began to call upon Goddess Adishakti and a heavenly light that emanated from their bodies gave her a physical form.Mahishasura and Goddess Shakti engaged in combat despite the fact that he was destined to die at her hands. The war lasted for nine days and she defeated him on the tenth day and the festival of Navaratri came into existence ever since. Vijayadashami is commemorated after the conclusion of the auspicious nine days to mark the day the ferocious demon was eliminated. Notably, the day is also celebrated as Dussehra because Lord Ram killed demon king Ravan on the same day. Vijayadashami is an observance of the triumph of Dharma over evil.Scientific RelevanceThe scientific value of Navratri is linked to both its religious and cultural significance. The festival coincides with the intersection of two seasons which has scientific merit. There is a sandhikaal (end of one season and beginning of another) during both Navratris of the year. The body’s adjustment to speech, phlegm and bile generally goes through phases of improvement and decline during this time which affects the immune system. This is the reason that nine days are dedicated to chanting, fasting, purification of the body, cleaning, meditation, havan and other practices to prevent multiple illnesses and have a clean environment.Economic ImportanceAnother very significant aspect of Navratri is its fiscal impact. Hindu events also have a substantial economic component. The income of those who create garba and diyas (clay Lamps) begins to rise at the start of Navratri. Garba is a celebration of the festival of goddess that is participated in by all devotees and it provides employment to the people who make earthen pots and lamps.Moreover, the way people dress traditionally during Navratri is also crucial and benefits those who create the outfits. Several people find work through both little and large purchases. People who produce or sell snacks, sweets, fruits and religious items, for instance, have considerable possibilities for work during Navratri. Therefore, it is equally important to take into account the financial implications of the festival.Importance of ‘Women Power’The significance of women power outweighs the religious, cultural and monetary worth of Navratri by multiple factors. Adishakti pervades the atom and governs the whole universe. Feminity or power of women is also a component of the goddess. A person’s strength is their potential and no work is possible without shakti (power) which is of unique importance in the entire world. Hence, it is worshipped in different places in various ways. It’s recognised as power energy by science. It is known as Shakti or even divine energy in the ancient Vedic faith. According to the Rig Veda, the universe in its entirety originated with a singular power and per science the universe is composed of one energy. The power of women brought prominence to the world just as the universe has emerged from the primal power. Therefore, women power is regarded as an expression of Adishakti.Navratri also serves as a celebration of female empowerment. Navratri is also considered dedicated to women power. Girls are worshipped on the day of Durgashtami and Mahanavami on the occasion of Navratri as they are considered to be the form of Goddess Durga. There is a custom of worshipping one to nine girls between the ages of 2 years to 10 years during the festival.The entire cosmos could not have been created without Goddess Durga who is nature and divinity. She is oxygen and completes Lord Shiva. Shiva and Shakti come together to form Ardhanarishvar (lord who is half feminine). Since Navratri is dedicated to women power and respects them. The fast and Durga Puja would be futile if one offends his mother, sister, wife, daughter or another female during this festival. Hence, Navratri imparts the essential message of honouring all women.Significance of GarbaThe word Garba is derived from the Sanskrit word ‘Garbhdeep’. The popularity of playing garba among young people has elevated significantly in recent times. The popularity of playing garba among young people has elevated tremendously in recent times. If we look at the intriguing background of this well-known and fascinating folk dance, we discover that doing Garba was formerly only a tradition in Rajasthan and Gujarat (notably Saurashtra and Kutch). However, it gained popularity and spread to other parts of India. Now, people take part in Garba all around the country. Garba programs are organised in temples and houses. Nine holes are punched into Garba and it is placed in the centre and everyone plays Raas-Garba around it. Nowadays, large Garba festivals are hosted by various organisations in which people participate.The holes represent the shape of the human body while the lamp therein symbolises the flame form of the soul. The former indicates the nine doors of the human body which include the two eyes, two ears, two noses (nostrils), mouth, anus and genitalia. A person’s soul exits their body through any of these openings when they die. A lamp is continuously lit for nine days with the conviction that the self-flame is perpetually ignited.Apart from this, 27 holes are made in Garba in many places, however, the mystery of it is unknown. Garba is viewed as a representation of the universe and the 27 pores (9 in 3 lines) are interpreted as a depiction of the 27 constellations and each of them has 4 phases through which the number 27 X 4 = 108 is obtained. Therefore, it is believed that rotating the Garbi 108 times by placing the Garba in the middle is equal to the virtue of circumambulating the universe.Method and tradition of worshipNine forms of Goddess Durga are worshipped during Navratri. Each day is dedicated to the worship of a different form. The nine manifestations of the goddess are Shailputri, Brahmacharini, Chandraghanta, Kushmanda, Skanda Mata, Katyayani, Kalratri, Maha Gauri and Siddhidatri. Goddess Durga along with her family, based on religious beliefs, rode her Vahan (carrier/vehicle) from Kailash to Earth on the first day of Navratri. It is crucial to invoke the goddess during the Navratri fast. Invocation means inviting the deity into the house for a specific goal or accomplishment. The installation of the Kumbhasthapana or Kalash comes first in the procedure of worshipping Goddess Shakti. It must be installed if one fast for nine days during Navratri and should do the same even on the first or the day of Ashtami. According to the Devi Purana, it is very important to establish a Kalash in the house before worshipping Goddess Bhagavati. It is erected during worship as an image of the goddess’s strength and as a site of pilgrimage. The Kalash is viewed as a representation of wealth, joy and elegance. Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, Lord Shiva and the heavenly mother force all reside in it.The worship of Goddess Shakti can take place in multiple ways and there are numerous methods to do it which comprise yajna-yagya (ritual done in front of a sacred fire), havan (sacred purification ritual), vrat (fast), japa (meditative repetition of a mantra or a divine name), tapa (asceticism, spiritual discipline) and dhyana (meditation) among other things are performed. Chandipath, BhavanyaShtakam and Shakradaya Stuti have a very special significance in Navratri. Yajna is carried out during Navratri at any divine religious place. It is a method in the Vedic tradition that displays a profound mysticism and the culmination of spiritual power.Note: Read the report in Gujarati here.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

27,"22 October, 2023 ","UK: Metropolitan Police defends open calls for Jihad in Central London, says it was said in a different context","It must be mentioned that while Jihad means 'struggle' or 'fight' in Arabic, it implies spreading Islam through violent conquest in the religious context.Amidst the ongoing war between Hamas and the State of Israel, the Metropolitan Police in the United Kingdom downplayed open calls for jihad raised by Hamas supporters in Central London.An X (formerly Twitter) user shared a video wherein members of a radical Islamist outfit named ‘Hizb ut-Tahrir’ were seen proclaiming ‘jihad’ against the State of Israel.“What is the solution to liberate people from the concentration camp called Palestine?” an Islamist was heard saying in the viral video. The mob of Hamas supporters cheered in unison, “Jihad, Jihad, Jihad.”""What is the solution to liberate people from the concentration camp called Palestine?""""Jihad! Jihad! Jihad!""From the Hizb ut Tahrir demonstration pic.twitter.com/Ba5CfkiOsyInstead of taking cognisance of the matter, the UK’s Metropolitan Police came out in defence of the Islamists and said that calls for jihad against Israel had nothing to do with terrorism. In a contentious tweet, it said, “The word jihad has a number of meanings but we know the public will most commonly associate it with terrorism. We have specialist counter-terrorism officers here in the operations room who have particular knowledge in this area.”“They have assessed this video, filmed at the Hizb ut-Tahrir protest in central London today, and have not identified any offences arising from the specific clip,” the police downplayed the act of Hamas supporters.The word jihad has a number of meanings but we know the public will most commonly associate it with terrorism. We have specialist counter terrorism officers here in the operations room who have particular knowledge in this area.They have assessed this video, filmed at the Hizb…“However, recognising the way language like this will be interpreted by the public and the divisive impact it will have, officers have identified the man involved and will be speaking to him shorty to discourage any repeat of similar chanting,” it added.It must be mentioned that while Jihad means ‘struggle’ or ‘fight’ in Arabic, it implies spreading Islam through violent conquest in the religious context.The Metropolitan police also attempted to give a clean chit to an Islamist, who was seen waving a jihadist flag in support of Hamas terrorists. It alleged, “The flags in this photo are not those of ISIS. They are the ‘shahada’ which is a declaration of faith in Islam.” The flags in this photo are not those of ISIS. They are the ‘shahada’ which is a declaration of faith in Islam. ISIS flags may appear similar but are not the same. We have specialist officers with knowledge of flags working on this operation to assist with these assessments.“ISIS flags may appear similar but are not the same. We have specialist officers with knowledge of flags working on this operation to assist with these assessments,” the cops claimed. It must be mentioned that the X user did not make any mention of ISIS and had merely pointed out about the vicious Islamist sloganeering.The Metropolitan police went out of their way to claim that the flag raised at the pro-Hamas rally was not dangerous and that it did not belong to ISIS. Netizens were forced to add community notes to the response of the cops, which negated their attempt to downplay the waving of a jihadist flag.“While the flag is not an ISIS flag, it is known as the jihadist flag used by Al-Qaeda and associated with holy war and a caliphate. In addition, the filmed person explicitly screams “Islamic State”, “Allah curse the Jews”, and “Allah curse the disbelievers” in Arabic,” the community notes read.Just like the Uk’s Metropolitan Police, the Leicester police has been at the forefront of a misinformation campaign that endangered the lives of Hindus in the city, following the Asia Cup group stage match between India and Pakistan on August 28, 2022.In a letter to the Leicester Council of Faiths on August 31 last year, Chief Inspector Paul Allen falsely claimed that a small group of people called for the death of Muslims and Pakistan. He alleged that the provocative slogans were raised in Hindi, indicating that it must have been the handiwork of the Indian Hindu diaspora. “Unfortunately, a small minority of people began chanting in a racially offensive way, calling for (we believe) “death to Pakistan” and “Death to Muslims” In Hindi,” he had claimed initially.His email, the transcript of which has now gone viral on social media, was in reference to a minor scuffle that took place in Belgrave Road of Leicester. The grave assertion made by police chief Paul Allen gave a free licence to Islamists to unleash havoc on the Hindu community.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

On 21st October (Saturday), the TMC declined to comment on the alleged scam involving of its Lok Sabha MP Mahua Moitra. Speaking to ANI, TMC State General Secretary Kunal Ghosh asserted that the party has nothing to say on the allegations levelled against Moitra. Speaking on behalf of the party, he maintained silence on the particular issue. Ghosh said, “..No comments on this particular issue. We have nothing to say on this issue. Regarding this issue, the All India Trinamool Congress will not say a single word. The related person may answer this, not the TMC party.”#WATCH | West Bengal | Allegations of bribery against TMC MP Mahua Moitra: TMC State General Secretary Kunal Ghosh says, ""…No comments…Regarding this issue, the TMC will not say anything… The related person may answer this, not the TMC party…"" pic.twitter.com/uIqFZSeDE1Similarly, another senior TMC leader, on the condition of anonymity, told PTI that Trinamool Congress is unwilling to get into a controversy and thus “will be maintaining distance from it.” However, the TMC has not taken action against her or sacked her from the party either. Another vocal face of the TMC, Derek O’Brein, who has been active on social media and defends even fake news peddlers like party MP Saket Gokhale, has also maintained an eerie silence on this issue. Rather he has been speaking actively on the queer issues. It is important to note that in the past several years, Moitra had been the vocal face of TMC on the national stage but the party has maintained distance from her ever since the cash-for-query allegations were levelled against the TMC leader.Following the development, BJP leader Rahul Sinha asserted that the TMC can’t shrug off its responsibility by distancing itself from Mahua Moitra. He said, “The TMC always tries to shrug off its responsibility whenever its leaders are either arrested or land into trouble. The TMC needs to explain whether it supports Mahua Moitra or not.” Meanwhile, TMC Lok Sabha MP from Krishnanagar, Mahua Moitra has been actively tweeting over the issue claiming innocence in the Mahuagate. In a series of tweets on 21st October, she expressed her frustration over the current allegations against her and made various claims in this regard.However, she didn’t deny taking luxury gifts in exchange for asking questions in Lok Sabha, and also didn’t deny that billionaire businessman Darshan Hiranandani was using her Parliamentary portal account to post questions targeting Adani directly. Instead, she argued that every parliamentarian shares login IDs and passwords with staff, interns and others, asking the National Informatics Centre to disclose the details of the places from where the IDs of all the Members of Parliament were accessed.It is notable that BJP MP Nishikant Dubey said in an X post that Mahua Moitra’s NIC ID was being accessed from Dubai. In an affidavit filed with the Parliamentary Ethics Committee, Hiranandani Group CEO Darshan Hiranandani acknowledged that the TMC MP provided him with her Parliamentary login credentials which he used to ask questions from the central government on her behalf. Darshan Hiranandani is based in Dubai, and his affidavit was also signed in Dubai and was notarised by the Consulate General of India in Dubai. He also said that he had given luxury gifts and other favours to Mahua Moitra.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Are all of them with permission? No, but in this case, we have been seeking permission for the last four months. Why it was not given? And what is the necessity for the police to go there in mass and take that (flag pole) out in the wee hours? What is the need?

She asserted that there is a conspiracy against Muslims and Islam in calling Hamas a terror organisation.On Friday (20th October), the national spokesperson of Samajwadi Party and poet Munawar Rana’s daughter Sumaiya Rana justified Palestinian terrorist group Hamas’s attacks on Israel which resulted in the death of over 1300 civilians. While speaking to News18, Rana claimed that Hamas is not a terrorist group, rather they are fighting to protect Al-Aqsa Mosque. She asserted that there is a conspiracy against Muslims and Islam in calling Hamas a terror organisation.“Everyone can see Hamas’s attack on Israel but no one is noticing the internal damage inflicted on Palestine,” Sumaiya Rana said while justifying Hamas’s onslaught. She added that lakhs of Palestinians have been killed over the last ten years by Israel.#HamasTerrorists did nothing wrong by kiIIing innocent Israelis, they should have done more damage – SP leader Sumaiya Rana (daughter of IsIamist Shayar Munnavar Rana)This is how IsIamists across the world think… They don't even shy away from defending terrorism. pic.twitter.com/SX3yRpgLNPShe further expressed her apprehension that the Israel-Hamas war may transition into a third-world war since several countries are getting involved in it.When asked about Hamas’s decision to attack innocent Israeli civilians, Sumaiya Rana asserted that Hamas’s attacks on Israeli people are due to the ongoing conflict pertaining to the land as well as ‘atrocities’ on Palestinians over the last decade. The Samajwadi Party leader went on to say that Hamas’s ‘reaction’ “is still not up to the level” and that Hamas will not back off.“They [Hamas terrorists] have understood that they have been given this life only to defend Al-Aqsa mosque and that is why they have dedicated their lives for this only,” Rana said.She further demonised the Israeli people labelling them as the most “cruel” community. The Hamas sympathiser went on to claim that Palestine is paying the price of giving refuge to the Jews. Sumaiya Rana added that the animosity between Jews and Muslims has been ongoing since the times of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.“They [Israelis] are inflicting atrocities on the followers of Islam and this conflict will never be resolved with dialogue. It will be resolved only when one of the sides dominates the other,” Rana asserted.She further pushed Hamas’s narrative that Israel had attacked the Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza which allegedly killed over 500 people. This comes even as multiple evidence suggest that Israel was not behind the attack.Despite being repeatedly questioned about Hamas’s killing of innocent Israelis in a brutal attack launched on 7th October, Rana downplayed Hamas’s offensive claiming that Israel has already been attacking Palestine.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

This decision of the apparel company came amid the ongoing Israeli military operations against Hamas in Gaza in retaliation to the horrific terror attack by Hamas on Israel on 7 October. The owner of the business has cited moral grounds for his decision, accusing Israel of atrocities on Palestinians in Gaza. This company is situated in Kannur district of Kerala.The Maryan Apparel Pvt Limited’s Thomas Olickal stated the company has decided not to accept any fresh orders from the Israel police force until the conflict in Gaza is resolved. The classy light blue uniform shirts for the Israel police force are produced by Maryan Apparel Pvt Limited in Kerala’s Kannur district.Thomas Olickal said, “We have been making uniforms for the Israeli police since 2015. The Hamas attack, killing civilians cannot be accepted. Similarly, the revenge by Israel also cannot be accepted. Denying food and water to over 25 lakh people, bombing hospitals, killing innocent women and children and all cannot be accepted at all. We want the war to end and the peace to prevail.”It is notable that now it has been proven that it was a failed rocket fired into Israel from Gaza that fell on a Gaza hospital, but the owner of the garment company is still blaming Israel for the same. Initially, Hamas had claimed that the hospital was hit by an Israeli air strike and over 500 people died. But later it was found that a rocket fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad had failed and hit the parking lot of the hospital, and the actual number of casualties was much less.Thomas Olickal added, “We request everyone to stop the war. The Israel force will not be short of uniforms because of our decision. But this is a moral decision. The bombing of the hospitals cannot be accepted. We have decided not to take further orders temporarily.”He further stated that his company will respect current contracts by international agreements, but will not accept new orders until the conflict is over. He said, “In a year we make up to one lakh shirts for Israeli policemen. We also make shirts and jackets for the Israeli Jail Police. About 30,000 to 50,000 shirts and jackets are sent for the jail police in a year.” He also said that last week after the war broke out, the company was informed by Israel that an extra supply of uniforms would be needed.Maryan Apparel Pvt Limited, which was founded in 2006 in the Kerala state-run Kinfra Park here, specialises in the uniforms of army troops, police officials, security officers, and health care professionals from all over the world. It also provides school uniforms, supermarket employee outfits, physicians’ jackets, coveralls, business attire, and other items.On 7th October, Hamas terrorists entered Israel using motor gliders, boats, and trucks, targeting civilians and Israeli soldiers. Since then, Hamas has taken over 300 people hostage. In response, Israel has launched counterattacks on the Islamic terrorists, vowing to dismantle their infrastructure.Amidst the ongoing violence, reports of a devastating explosion at the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in the Gaza Strip emerged. Palestinians and several Arab countries, including Jordan, Turkey, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, were quick to point fingers at Israel, accusing them of deliberately targeting the medical facility. The Kerala-based company has also cited the attack on the hospital as the reason to break the clothing supply chain of Israeli forces. Media houses like Al Jazeera, the Iranian channel Press TV, and the likes of Alt News co-founder Mohammed Zubair ran propaganda being pushed by Hamas, claiming it was an Israeli rocket. Later, multiple proofs appeared making it clear that Israel did not attack the hospital. It was revealed that the rocket that fell on the hospital was not shot by Israel but by an Iran-backed terrorist organisation, Islamic Jihad, that operates from Gaza.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

32,"20 October, 2023 ","Amid the India-Canada standoff, India has, under the leadership of PM Modi, made it clear that we are no more a pushover nation","Besides India's stern approach towards Canada, it's neutral stance over the Russia-Ukraine war and India's strong retaliation to China's Galwan misadventure, that has strongly signalled to the world that the days of India caving in to pressure from world powers are long gone by. On Friday, October 20, Canada withdrew 41 diplomats and their families from India. The move came after India gave an ultimatum for revoking the diplomatic immunity of those diplomats who stayed back post-10th of October even after being told to leave.Diplomatic ties between India and Canada nose-dived after Canada prematurely expelled an Indian diplomat on the 19th of September following baseless allegations by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of the involvement of Indian agents in the murder of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. India went on to promptly expel a Canadian diplomat in a tit-for-tat response to Ottawa’s expulsion of an Indian official over the case. New Delhi also suspended visa services for Canadian nationals.The chill in relations between the two countries was even evident at the G20 Leaders’ Summit in New Delhi on September 9 and 10, so much so that even local Canadian media chastised its Prime Minister for being overlooked by Indian and other foreign leaders during the G20 Summit.As the bilateral relations between Canada and India worsen, several reports suggest that Canada has been desperately trying to diffuse the diplomatic row with India. India, on its part, has made it clear that it is no longer a pushover nation and would not tolerate acts of aggression, hate, and intimidation from the rest of the world. The Western big powers like the US, Russia and the UK have also when it came to the India-Canada standoff, chosen to steer clear of strongly-worded public statements that would antagonise India, fearing diplomatic backlash from one of the fastest-growing countries in the world and regarded as a potential counterweight to an increasingly assertive China. This is why, when the Canadian Prime Minister sought the support of many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, to raise the issue with India he was snubbed by everyone fearing diplomatic backlash from India.The USA, which has a habit of interfering in every nation’s domestic affairs, was also compelled to toe a fine diplomatic line when it came to the India-Canada standoff. While avoiding offending Canada, one of its closest allies, it did not dare to oppose India. This is primarily because, India, in recent years, has advanced to a position where it is seen as a crucial defence partner for the United States and an essential counterweight to China.The West, including Canada, also has other major things to consider when it comes to India, including strong defence and trade ties that both sides would rather see maintained and strengthened.Another major reason why the Western nations haven’t taken sides may be that they are aware that India’s demand for parity in mutual diplomatic presence does not violate any international rules. In fact, when Canada accused India of flouting the Vienna Convention in withdrawing diplomatic immunity from 41 Canadian diplomats, India strongly responded to Canada’s statement on the withdrawal of some of its diplomats following India’s prod and said no international norm was violated seeking parity in the mutual diplomatic presence in New Delhi and Ottawa. Basically, the Canadian presence in India is much more than India’s presence in Canada. Therefore, India has asked Canada to take back the excess diplomats so that it is equal to Indian diplomats in Canada.Moreover, the West is also completely aware that India is well aware that it has the upper hand and that, if it chooses, it can turn the faucet off and hurt Canada where it hurts the most.The majority of overseas students studying in Canada are from India. According to statistics provided by the Canadian government, around 40% of the 8 lakh international students studying in Canada at the moment are from India. Indian students pay three to five times more in tuition than Canadians do at private colleges. In a sense, Indians support the entire Canadian private college ecosystem, which will disintegrate if the Indian government decides to stop the outflow. Moreover, as many as 600 Canadian companies, including Bombardier and SNC Lavalin, have a strong presence in India, while more than 30 Indian companies, such as infotech majors TCS, Infosys and Wipro have invested billions of dollars in Canada, creating thousands of jobs.The above multiple reasons might have also compelled Canada to change its rhetorics. On Tuesday, October 17, Trudeau and Foreign Minister Melanie Joly indicated that they did not want to fuel tensions with India by speaking about them publicly — a sharp contrast with the open claims against India that the prime minister made in parliament.It is, however, not just in reference to how India has been handling the India-Canada standoff but there are other recent bold decisions India has taken under the leadership of PM Modi like maintaining a neutral stance over the Russia-Ukraine war and India’s strong retaliation to China’s Galwan misadventure, that has strongly signalled to the world that India has a mind of its own and that the days of India caving in to pressure from world powers are long gone by.When Modi initially took office as Prime Minister in May 2014, nobody anticipated this three-time Chief Minister of Gujarat and outsider to Lutyens’ Delhi would become the nation’s top diplomat and steer foreign affairs like a gifted artist. But like in other areas, PM Modi took the initiative and crafted a new multi-dimensional foreign policy of multiple allegiances and issue-based allegiances, which has elevated India to the position of most sought-after partner on the international stage. After all, who could hug two arch-rivals- US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin with the same panache?It is difficult to think of another world leader who could tell Putin directly that this is “not the age of war,” and also persuade his foreign minister S Jaishankar to tell the arrogant West that “Europe’s problems are not the world’s problems,” while yet managing to maintain good relations with both sides.The West actually fought tooth and nail to have us on their side during the Russia-Ukraine war. India was under intense pressure from the United States to adopt a position. Despite the pressure, India resisted giving in. India remained impartial in regard to the situation between Russia and Ukraine despite pressure from the West.India’s toughness in its attitude was warmly received by the West, which was demonstrated by the fact that despite their differences, the U.S. and India have continued to have a strong collaboration in areas such as business, technology, security, and education.In June 2020, Indian and Chinese troops clashed in the Galwan Valley. The clash was the worst fighting in over four decades and resulted in severe casualties on both sides. The deaths of 20 Indian soldiers was the first time Indian Army personnel were killed on the Line of Actual Control since October 1975.China, still celebrating its victory in 1962, blatantly misjudged India’s resolve to oppose its land-grabbing strategies this time. Beijing was shocked when the Modi administration chose to protect India’s frontiers.At first, India and China had multiple rounds of discussions, both officially in Delhi and Beijing and at the level of military commanders on the LAC. However, when it became clear that China would not back down, India made the decision to establish trade limitations on Chinese investors and goods.The Indian government, led by Prime Minister Modi, authorized the Indian Army to respond to any further escalation on the front lines in a responsible manner. An example of this was the aggressive occupation of specific heights by Indian troops near the Pangong Tso on August 5, 2020, which caught China off guard.With its handling of China’s Galwan misadventure, India once again demonstrated to the world that it is no longer a nation to be taken lightly.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

33,"19 October, 2023 ",Theory of ‘Basic Structure’ and its impact on NJAC: Why a synthesized NJAC would be better than the Collegium system,"The National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act was passed in 2014 with the aim of introducing a new mechanism for appointments. However, in 2015, the Supreme Court struck down the NJAC Act, asserting that it violated the basic structure of the Constitution and upheld the primacy of the collegium system.The Constitution remains a living document that reflects the will of the people as expressed through its founding principles and values. The Constitution of India is made up of several key components that include the Preamble, Part III & Part IV of the Constitution of India. Additionally, it includes fundamental principles like democracy, secularism, socialism, and sovereignty, which guide the functioning of the Indian state. The Constitution establishes a federal parliamentary structure backed by three concrete independent yet assimilated and synergized pillars of powers separated out as the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.DISTRIBUTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL & LEGAL POWERSThe Constitution ensures the separation of powers by defining the roles, functions, and limitations of each branch. Additionally, it includes mechanisms to prevent one branch from unduly encroaching upon the powers of another. The specific allocation of powers in the Indian Constitution is a crucial feature that evolved to concretize a balance of power amongst all three domains and simultaneously ensure that one power constituent does not infringe upon the other’s sphere. The separation of powers is a fundamental feature of our Constitution that ensures the allocation of roles, responsibilities and powers to three distinct branches with inbuilt checks and balances.EXECUTIVE BRANCHThe executive branch consists of two separate sub-branches; one is administrative & the other is political executive. The administrative branch is committed to implementing and enforcing rules and regulations and protects the sanctity of the law of the land. The Political executive is represented by the President of India, the Vice President, and the Council of Ministers (headed by the Prime Minister). The executive branch is expected to run the day-to-day affairs of the government, making policy decisions, and implementing laws passed by the Legislature.LEGISLATIVE BRANCHThe legislative branch is primarily responsible for formulating laws. The legislative power is demonstrated by two houses – the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. The Parliament of India has the power to make, amend, and repeal laws on various subjects listed in the Constitution.JUDICIAL BRANCHThe judiciary is owed with responsibility to dispense justice & also interpret the laws. It is independent of the other two branches.ARTICLE 13Article 13 primarily focuses on safeguarding fundamental rights. It states that any law whether pre- or post-Constitution which is found in conflict with or at variance with fundamental rights shall be revoked to the extent of variance. It empowers the judiciary to review laws and, if necessary, strike them down if they violate fundamental rights. Article 13 provides a protective umbrella to maintain the inviolability of fundamental rights due to any legislative or executive action. The term “law” in Article 13 includes not only statutes and legislation passed by Parliament or State Legislatures but also ordinances, regulations, orders, bylaws, rules, and other forms of delegated or subordinate legislation. Article 13(2) empowers the judiciary, especially the Supreme Court and High Courts to review the constitutionality of laws where if any law is assessed to be in violation of fundamental rights and inherent spirits, the same can be suitably declared void to the extent of inconsistency. The Court held that an amendment under Article 368 is “law” within the meaning of Article 13 of the Constitution and therefore, if an amendment “takes away or abridges” a Fundamental Right conferred by Part III, it is void. In essence, Article 13 serves as a safeguard for the fundamental rights of Indian citizens and ensures that any existing law or new legislation that violates these rights can be declared void by the judiciary, upholding the supremacy of the Constitution. Article 13 is a critical tool in ensuring that fundamental rights are not violated or undermined by any legislative or executive action. It provides a mechanism for citizens to challenge laws that infringe upon their fundamental rights in the courts.ARTICLE 368Article 368 of the Constitution of India deals with the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution. It outlines the procedures and mechanisms for amending various parts of the Indian Constitution. It grants Parliament the power to amend various provisions of the Constitution. Article 368 confers upon the Parliament of India the power to amend the Constitution. It can amend any provision of the Constitution including the provisions related to the fundamental rights of citizens. Amendments can be made by introducing a bill in either house of Parliament (Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha). Some amendments can be passed by a simple majority of the members present and voting in each house. Certain other amendments, which are not related to the federal structure but still affect significant parts of the Constitution, require a special majority. This means they must be passed by most of the total membership of each house and by a two-thirds majority of the members present and voting. Article 368 itself contains an exception. It specifies that certain provisions of the Constitution, such as the federal structure, Parliamentary form of government etc. cannot be amended without the ratification of most state legislatures. Article 368 is crucial in understanding the process by which the Indian Constitution can be amended. The theory of Basic Structure impinges upon the ambit of amendment to any provisions of the Constitution of India.THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ARTICLE 13 AND ARTICLE 368 CAN BE UNDERSTOOD AS FOLLOWSArticle 13 acts as a watchdog on the power of Parliament as provided under Article 368. It ensures that while Parliament has the authority to amend the Constitution, it cannot do so in a manner that violates fundamental rights. Article 13 does not make all constitutional amendments invalid. Instead, it applies specifically to amendments that violate fundamental rights. If a constitutional amendment infringes upon fundamental rights, it can be declared void to that extent, as per Article 13. The doctrine of Basic structure limits the amending power of Parliament, is a product of judicial interpretation and was established in the Keshvanand Bharati case (1973). It harmonizes the powers of Article 13 and Article 368 by allowing amendments that do not affect the basic structure of the Constitution and ensuring that fundamental rights are protected. While Article 13 and Article 368 have different purposes, they work together to maintain a balance between amending the Constitution and protecting fundamental rights. The basic structure doctrine which is a judicially evolved concept in the epoch-making Keshwa NandThe Bharti case is a key element that reconciles by setting limits on the amendment power to prevent any alteration of the core principles of the Constitution. The Basic Structure is however not defined & is left to the interpretation of Justices of the bench, every time it gets constituted.OVERSTEPPING OF ORGANSLegislature Overstepping:The legislature may sometimes pass laws that are in violation of the Constitution. In such cases, the judiciary has the authority to strike down these laws through judicial review.Executive  Overstepping:The executive can issue ordinances in exceptional circumstances when Parliament is not in session. However, if the legislature excessively uses ordinances to bypass the normal legislative process, it can be seen as overstepping its authority. The President, on the advice of the Cabinet, can declare a state of emergency under specific circumstances. However, if the executive misuses emergency powers for political gain or to suppress dissent, it can be seen as overstepping its authority.Judiciary  Overstepping:While the judiciary’s role includes interpreting the Constitution and protecting fundamental rights, excessive judicial activism, where the judiciary takes on roles that are traditionally the domain of the executive or legislature, can be seen as overstepping. It’s important to note that the allocation of powers in the Indian Constitution is designed to create a delicate balance and each branch has specific checks and balances on the others to prevent overstepping. Additionally, the concept of judicial review allows the judiciary to strike down laws and actions that violate the Constitution, serving as a vital safeguard against overreach by the legislature and executive. In practice, maintaining this balance is an ongoing challenge, and instances of overstepping can arise. However, the system relies on the vigilance of each branch, as well as public awareness and engagement, to ensure that the principles of democracy and the rule of law are upheld. In any democratic system, including India, there is always the potential for one branch of government to overstep its authority, which can lead to a disruption of the system of checks and balances. Here are some common examples of overstepping of authority by the three branches of government in India: where the judiciary is perceived to have overstepped its boundaries into the legislative and executive domains in India, has been a subject of debate. While the judiciary’s role includes interpreting the Constitution and ensuring the protection of fundamental rights, there have been instances where it has made decisions that some critics argue encroach upon the functions of the other branches of government. The term “judicial activism” is often used to describe instances where the judiciary takes an active role in shaping public policy and governance. Critics argue that at times, judicial activism has led to the judiciary overstepping its role. For instance, in the case of Vishakha v. State of Rajasthan, the Supreme Court formulated guidelines on workplace sexual harassment even before specific legislation was enacted. While this was seen as a necessary step to protect women’s rights, it raised questions about whether the judiciary was intruding into legislative territory. The judiciary has been actively involved in environmental matters, issuing directives and guidelines to address issues like air pollution, river cleaning, and industrial pollution. While this has been necessary to protect the environment and public health, critics argue that such interventions sometimes bypass the executive’s role in crafting and implementing environmental policies. made by the executive. The judiciary has been involved in decisions related to religious practices. The Sabarimala temple entry case, where the Supreme Court allowed women of all ages to enter the temple, raised questions about whether the judiciary was infringing on religious traditions and practices, a domain traditionally left to religious authorities. The judiciary has been involved in issues related to reservation policies. In some cases, it has ordered changes in reservation criteria or questioned the implementation of reservation policies, which are primarily within the legislative domain. It’s essential to recognize that these instances of perceived judicial overreach often come with differing interpretations and perspectives. Some view them as necessary interventions to protect fundamental rights and uphold the rule of law, while others argue that they encroach on the legislative and executive functions. To address concerns about judicial overreach, there have been calls for greater clarity in the separation of powers, the need for well-defined roles and responsibilities of each branch of government, and discussions on judicial reform to ensure that the judiciary respects the boundaries set by the Constitution while upholding the rights and welfare of citizens. While the judiciary’s role includes interpreting the Constitution and protecting fundamental rights, and excessive judicial activism, the judiciary takes on roles that are traditionally the domain of the executive or legislature, which can be seen as overstepping.While judicial review is a crucial aspect of the separation of powers, an overly broad interpretation of this power can lead to a perception that the judiciary is encroaching on the legislative and executive domains. It’s important to note that the separation of powers in the Indian Constitution is designed to create a delicate balance and each branch has specific checks and balances on the others to prevent overstepping. Additionally, the concept of judicial review allows the judiciary to strike down laws and actions that violate the Constitution, serving as a vital safeguard against overreach by the legislature and executive. In practice, maintaining this balance is an ongoing challenge, and instances of overstepping can arise. However, the system relies on the vigilance of each branch, as well as public awareness and engagement, to ensure that the principles of democracy and the rule of law are upheld.KESHVANAND BHARTI CASEIn the Keshvanand Bharati case, relief was sought against the Kerala government vis-à-vis two state land reform laws, which imposed restrictions on the management of religious property. Question underlying the case: Was the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution unlimited? In other words, could Parliament alter, amend, or abrogate any part of the Constitution even to the extent of taking away all fundamental rights? The Constitutional Bench in the Keshvanand Bharati case ruled by a 7-6 verdict that Parliament could amend any part of the Constitution so long as it did not alter or amend the basic structure or essential features of the Constitution. However, the court did not define the term ‘basic structure’, and only listed a few principles — federalism, secularism, democracy — as being its part. The ‘basic  structure doctrine has since been interpreted to include:BASIC STRUCTUREThe basic structure doctrine was established in Keshvanand Bharati v. State of Kerala in 1973. In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, however, cannot do so in a manner that violates or alters its basic structure. This doctrine is significant because it places limitations on the amending power of the Indian Parliament, ensuring that the core principles and values of the Constitution remain intact and unaltered. It was developed to determine the limits of the amending power of Parliament (under Article 368) and to protect certain core principles and values of the Constitution. The power of judicial review, which empowers the judiciary to measure the constitutionality of laws and actions including constitutional amendments, is a vital part of the doctrine of Basic Structure. The primary aim of the basic structure doctrine is to ensure that the fundamental principles and essential features of the Constitution, which are vital for maintaining democracy, justice, equality, and the rule of law, are not arbitrarily or substantially altered through constitutional amendments. The basic structure doctrine is a legal principle developed by the Indian judiciary, particularly by the Supreme Court of India.CHANGE INEVITABLEThe architects of the Indian Constitution granted confirmed powers to Parliament as per the needs and demands of “We the People”. Article 368, which gives Parliament the power to amend the Constitution, can also be amended. The Constitution is an ever-developing index & a reflection of the collective consciousness of the citizens which embodies the spirit of the nation. The dynamism in the Constitution is integral, however, the Doctrine of Basic Structure impedes the dynamism. The impact of the past enriches it now and makes the future richer than the present.” A provision for amending the Constitution has been made to address any challenges “We the People” may face in the future as the Constitution functions since time is not static; it is always changing, just as the political, economic, and social circumstances of the people do.APPOINTMENT OF JUSTICES PRIOR TO 1993Before the introduction of the collegium system in 1993, the appointment of judges to the higher Courts in India, including the Supreme Court and High Courts, was primarily made under the provisions of Article 124 and Article 217 of the Indian Constitution. The Chief Justice of India, as the head of the judiciary, would recommend the names of candidates for appointment as judges to the President. These recommendations were often made after consultation with other senior judges, both within the Supreme Court and the concerned High Court. The President of India, bound by the advice of the Council of Ministers (the executive branch), would make the final appointments based on the recommendations received from the Chief Justice and the Executive. The executive branch played a significant role in the appointment process. The President would consider the recommendations and could seek further information or clarification if necessary. In practice, the government had a significant say in the appointment process. While the Chief Justice’s recommendations were considered, the government’s role in the final decision often led to allegations of political influence in judicial appointments. The introduction of the collegium system in 1993 marked a significant shift in the appointment process. Under the collegium system, a group of senior judges of the Supreme Court, including the Chief Justice of India, became responsible for recommending candidates for judicial appointments. This system was cited as aimed at enhancing the independence of the judiciary in the appointment process. It means that all appointments of justices up to 1993 were incorrect and subject to legislative and executive interference. It is assumed that the frailties of the appointment of justice were over with the introduction of a collegium system with necessary transparency and accountability. The question of whether all judicial appointments made before the introduction of the collegium system in 1993 were “incorrect” or subject to legislative and executive interference is a matter of perspective and legal interpretation. The introduction of the collegium system was aimed at addressing certain perceived shortcomings in the earlier appointment process and enhancing the independence of the judiciary, but it does not inherently render all prior appointments “incorrect.”ADVENT OF COLLEGIUMThe collegium system was introduced through a series of judicial pronouncements and not through a specific legislative enactment. It evolved gradually over several decades. The term “collegium” itself was coined in the 1990s. The idea of judicial consultation in the appointment of judges can be traced back to various judicial precedents. For example, in the 1977 case of S.P. Gupta v. Union of India, commonly known as the “First Judges Case,” the Supreme Court held that the Chief Justice of India (CJI) should consult with a plurality of judges to make recommendations for appointments of Justices. The significant development in the establishment of the collegium system came in the Second Judges Case, also known as the Advocates-on-Record Association v. Union of India (1993). In this case, the Supreme Court held that the CJI should make recommendations to the President in consultation with a collegium of senior judges. The court ruled that the executive’s role should be limited to appointing judges based on these recommendations. Following the Second Judges Case, the collegium system became the standard practice for judicial appointments in India. The system evolved over time, and the composition of the collegium varied, but it generally included the CJI and a group of senior judges of the Supreme Court. Several other cases and judgments in subsequent years further clarified and reaffirmed the collegium system’s role in the appointments and transfers of judges.NJACNational Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC): The issue of judicial appointments faced significant debate and controversy, leading to attempts to change the appointment process. The National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act was passed in 2014 with the aim of introducing a new mechanism for appointments. However, in 2015, the Supreme Court struck down the NJAC Act, asserting that it violated the basic structure of the Constitution and upheld the primacy of the collegium system. NJAC was an attempt to reform the judiciary’s appointment process and may not be seen as legislative overreach per se, the judiciary’s concerns about the potential impact on judicial independence were central to the court’s decision. This complex issue reflects the ongoing debate about the balance between the branches of government and the role of the judiciary in safeguarding the Constitution in India’s democratic system.EXISTING ARRANGEMENTIt is true that the appointment process before the judiciary evolved into the collegium system, allowing involvement and influence from the executive branch, particularly in the final decision-making stage. This sometimes led to allegations of political interference in judicial appointments. While the introduction of the collegium system was a significant step toward enhancing judicial independence in the appointment process, it does not necessarily render all appointments made before 1993 as “incorrect.” The issue of judicial appointments is complex and has evolved over time in response to various challenges and concerns. The collegium system is one of the many mechanisms designed to address these concerns, but it is not without its own set of criticisms and debates. While the judiciary plays a vital role in safeguarding the Constitution, it also has its limitations. It cannot directly enforce its decisions, relying on the executive branch to implement them. Leaving the judiciary as the sole custodian may raise questions about democratic accountability. Judges are not elected representatives, and some argue that their power should be checked by elected officials who are directly accountable to the people. The theory of separation of powers suggests that no single branch of government should have unchecked authority. While the judiciary’s independence is crucial, an appropriate balance of powers among the branches is essential for a well-functioning democracy. The power to amend the Constitution (under Article368) lies with the legislature. If the judiciary was the sole custodian, it could potentially limit the ability of the legislature to make necessary constitutional amendments. In practice, the Indian Constitution is committed to establishing a system of balance among the three branches of government: the executive, the legislature, and the judiciary. While the judiciary plays a significant role in interpreting and upholding the Constitution, it does so within the broader framework of democratic governance.Ambedkar said, “However good the Constitution is, it might turn out not to be good if the people were administering it bad however bad the Constitution is, it might do its job well if people administering it happen to be good.” “Enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm” and “if men were angels, no government would be necessary”, we get to an axiomatic idea of checks and balances.The question of whether the judiciary alone the custodian of the Constitution of India should be is a matter of considerable debate and has been a subject of discussion in legal and political circles.JUDICIARY AS CUSTODIAN OF THE CONSTITUTIONThe judiciary is designed to be an independent branch of government, which is essential for interpreting and upholding the Constitution impartially. Its decisions are not influenced by political considerations.Judges have legal expertise and training, which makes them well-suited to interpreting and applying the Constitution’s provisions and principles accurately.The judiciary serves as a check on the actions of the executive and legislative branches to ensure that they are in conformity with the Constitution. This helps prevent potential abuse of power.The power of judicial review allows the judiciary to strike down laws and actions that violate the Constitution. This is a critical mechanism for protecting individual rights and preserving constitutional values.COUNTERVIEW OF JUDICIARY AS SINGLE CUSTODIAN OF THE CONSTITUTIONWhile the judiciary plays a vital role in safeguarding the Constitution, it also has its limitations. It cannot directly enforce its decisions, relying on the executive branch to implement them.Leaving the judiciary as the sole custodian may raise questions about democratic accountability. Judges are not elected representatives, and some argue that their power should be checked by elected officials who are directly accountable to the people.The separation of powers doctrine suggests that no single branch of government should have unchecked authority. While the judiciary’s independence is crucial, an appropriate balance of powers among the branches is essential for a well-functioning democracy.The power to amend the Constitution (under Article 368) lies with the legislature. If the judiciary were the sole custodian, it could potentially limit the ability of the legislature to make necessary constitutional amendments.The consensus in most democratic systems is that the Constitution should be a shared responsibility, with each branch of government playing a role in its protection and preservation. The exact balance between these branches can vary from one country to another, depending on the specific constitutional framework and historical context.HERE IS HOW THE APPOINTMENT PROCESS WORKED PRIOR TO THE COLLEGIUM SYSTEMBefore the introduction of the collegium system in 1993, the appointment of judges to the higher courts in India, including the Supreme Court and High Courts, was primarily made by the President of India in consultation with the Chief Justice of India. This method was based on Article 124 and Article 217 of the Indian Constitution. The CJI, SC as the head of the judiciary,would recommend the names of candidates for appointment as judges to the President. These recommendations were often made after consultation with other senior justices, both within the Supreme Court and the concerned High Court. President’s Decision: The President of India, acting on the advice of the Council of Ministers (the executive branch), would make the final appointments based on the recommendations received from the Chief Justice and the Executive.The executive branch played a significant role in the appointment process. The President would consider the recommendations and could seek further information or clarification if necessary.In practice, the government had a significant say in the appointment process. While the Chief Justice’s recommendations were taken into account, the government’s role in the final decision often led to allegations of political influence in judicial appointments.The introduction of the collegium system in 1993 affected the process of appointment of judges significantly, tilting the weight towards the judiciary. Under the collegium system, a group of senior judges of the Supreme Court, including the Chief Justice of India, became responsible for recommending candidates for judicial appointments. The system was said to be committed to ushering in the independence of the judiciary. It’s important to note that the collegium system itself has faced criticism and debate, with some arguing that it lacks transparency and accountability. The issue of judicial appointments in India has been the subject of ongoing reform discussions, and various proposals for change have been considered over the years.The question of whether all judicial appointments made before the introduction of the collegium system in 1993 were “incorrect” or subject to legislative and executive interference is a matter of perspective and legal interpretation. The introduction of the collegium system was aimed at addressing certain perceived shortcomings in the earlier appointment process and enhancing the independence of the judiciary, but it does not inherently render all prior appointments “incorrect.”It is true that the appointment process before the collegium system allowed for involvement and influence from the executive branch, particularly in the final decision-making stage. This sometimes led to allegations of political interference in judicial appointments.The introduction of the collegium system was one of several reforms aimed at improving the appointment process and reducing the potential for political interference. However, no system is without its own criticisms and challenges.Appointing judges to the higher courts is a complex and nuanced process. It involves considerations of legal expertise, integrity, experience, and the need to uphold the independence of the judiciary. Different systems and mechanisms have been used to strike the right balance between these considerations.The collegium system did not retroactively invalidate appointments made before its introduction. Judicial decisions made by judges appointed under the previous system remain valid and legally binding.The debate over judicial appointments and reforms in this area continues in India. Various proposals and discussions have taken place regarding potential improvements to the appointment process, including increasing transparency and accountability.In summary, while the introduction of the collegium system was a significant step toward enhancing judicial independence in the appointment process, it does not necessarily render all appointments made before 1993 as “incorrect.” The issue of judicial appointments is complex and has evolved over time in response to various challenges and concerns. The collegium system is one of the many mechanisms designed to address these concerns, but it is not without its own set of criticisms and debates.The collegium system for the appointment and transfer of judges in India was introduced through a series of judicial pronouncements and not through a specific legislative enactment. It evolved gradually over several decades. The term “collegium” itself was coined in the 1990s.Following the Second Judges Case, the collegium system became the standard practice for judicial appointments in India. The system evolved over time, and the composition of the collegium varied, but it generally included the CJI and a group of senior judges of the Supreme Court. The collegium system, as it stands today, remains the predominant method for appointing and transferring judges in the higher judiciary in India. It is based on judicial interpretations and pronouncements, making it a unique and distinctive feature of India’s legal system.The issue of judicial appointments faced significant debate and controversy, leading to attempts to change the appointment process. The National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act was passed in 2014 with the aim of introducing a new mechanism for appointments. However, in 2015, the Supreme Court struck down the NJAC Act, asserting that it violated the basic structure of the Constitution and upheld the primacy of the collegium system. The very fact that  the NJAC  was  struck  null  &  void is  itself a  violation  of  the  basic  structure  of  theConstitution of India as it is nowhere prevalent that justice chooses justice which may lead to favoritism to family members & friends. In the absence of a strict definition of the Basic Structure of the Constitution, it is well nigh appropriate to deduce that the Judiciary overstepped & violated the Basic Structure & tenets associated with it. The provisions as enshrined in Article 124 and Article 217 of the Indian Constitution were inviolable & power & appointment could not have been concentrated within a fold by one of the organs unilaterally. If that is true, all other constitutional & sensitive appointments may be determined by concerned departments under the same pleas of keeping interference of other organs let it be executive, legislative & judiciary. Judiciary alone cannot be accorded special status as fundamentally deemed non-interfering & neutral pillar out of three pillars. While preserving the independence of the judiciary is a paramount requirement, the NJAC with assimilated & synthesized composition would have offered a better & competent option within the ambit of the Basic Structure.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

34,"17 October, 2023 ",Promotion of Tribal Cultural Heritage and its importance to decolonisation and nation building: How the Modi govt has taken strides in this direction,"The story of Bharat is a story of its indigenous identity and heritage, and by reclaiming the narrative on Bharatiyata with an autochthonous renascence of its tribal components, we can build a truly decolonized discourse for a civilizational resurgence, in our bid to become a Vishwa Guru again.India is home to a diverse array of tribal communities, each with its distinct languages, customs, and traditions, contributing to the rich cultural tapestry of the nation. These indigenous tribes have inhabited India’s forests, hills, and plains for centuries, maintaining a harmonious relationship with nature and embodying a unique way of life. With a deep-rooted connection to their ancestral lands, tribal societies often exhibit close-knit communal structures and practices that have evolved over generations. The tribes of India possess an invaluable repository of traditional knowledge, encompassing everything from herbal medicine and sustainable farming practices to intricate craftsmanship and artistry. Despite modern advancements, preserving the traditions and well-being of India’s tribes remains crucial for maintaining cultural diversity and ensuring the equitable development of the nation. As Padma Vibhushan Dr. M.S. Swaminathan, the main architect of India’s Green Revolution, once said“One of India’s major blessings is the rich store of experience and knowledge available in the rural and tribal areas.”There are some unique indigenous tribal cultural dimensions in India that are not found anywhere else in the world. The Kattunayakan tribe in the Nilgiri Hills of southern India has a unique tradition of honey hunting. They follow ancient rock paintings that depict honey collection methods, utilizing a remarkable symbiotic relationship with local bees to gather honey. The Tangkhul Naga tribe in Manipur celebrates a distinctive festival called Lui-Ngai-Ni, where men demonstrate their strength by pulling huge stone slabs across the village. This ritual reflects their cultural heritage and emphasizes community bonding. The Mishing tribe of Assam practices a unique form of pottery known as Ali Aye Ligang. During this traditional festival, women create intricate clay pots using distinct patterns, symbolizing fertility, prosperity, and the tribe’s cultural identity. The Warli tribe, residing in the Western Ghats of Maharashtra, is renowned for its tribal art characterized by simplistic geometric shapes and patterns. This traditional art form, often used to depict daily life and rituals, has gained global recognition for its distinctive style. As an environmental activist and ecofeminist, Dr. Vandana Shiva once said,“The heartbeat of our land is echoed in the rhythms of Adivasi cultures, enriching our diversity and teaching us the value of unity.”Since coming into power in 2014, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has emphasized the preservation and revitalization of India’s diverse cultural heritage, including the rich traditions of its tribal communities. Through various initiatives and policies, the government has aimed to foster a cultural resurgence that recognizes the importance of tribal identity, traditions, and customs. One of the premier initiatives to celebrate and showcase India’s tribal heritage is the Aadi Mahotsav, started in 2017 by the Union Ministry of Tribal Affairs and the Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India (TRIFED).  It gives indigenous communities the opportunity to showcase tribal products and help artisans connect with the mainstream population at the National Tribal Crafts Expo. In 2023, more than one thousand tribal artisans and artists from 28 states and union territories participated in the festival. The Modi government introduced the Van Dhan Yojana, which focuses on enhancing tribal livelihoods through value addition to forest produce. This policy empowers tribal communities by providing them with training, technology, and market access to develop and market their traditional products, thereby preserving their cultural practices. The government established the Eklavya Model Residential Schools to provide quality education to tribal children while respecting their cultural sensitivities. These schools offer a curriculum that combines mainstream education with the preservation of tribal languages, traditions, and knowledge. The government has actively implemented the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act (PESA), allowing tribal communities greater control over local governance and natural resources. This policy safeguards their cultural heritage by recognizing their authority over land, resources, and decision-making processes. This government also elected to the seat of the President of India Shrimati Draupadi Murmu, who belongs to the Adivasi Santal community, in a move that truly showed that we are on the path towards decolonization and embracing our indigenous heritage and roots with sincerity and integrity. She once famously said,“It is a tribute to the power of our democracy that a daughter born in a poor house in a remote tribal area can reach the highest constitutional position in India. And it is a matter of great satisfaction for me that those who have been deprived for centuries and those who have been denied the benefits of development, those poor, downtrodden, backwards and tribals are seeing their reflection in me. From Santhal revolution, Paika revolution to Kol revolution and Bhil revolution, all these revolutions had strengthened the tribal contribution in the freedom struggle. I am happy that many museums are being built across the country dedicated to the role of the tribal communities in our freedom struggle. I was born in that tribal tradition which has lived in harmony with nature for thousands of years.”With 2023 being observed as the International Year of Millets, the Union government has laid emphasis on the importance of millets in the tribal areas of the country. Millets are often called `Shree Anna’ which means `the honoured grain’ or `the mother of all grains’. Mahatma Gandhi once said: “In the richness of millets, we rediscover ancient wisdom and modern sustenance, a testament to the resilience of traditional crops.” An interesting case of how governmental intervention has helped with the resurgence of consumption of Shree Anna in rural India is the Korku tribe of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, which had a nutritional downslide in the 1970s when they rapidly moved away from millets to soybean and wheat, leading to malnutrition and worsening health conditions. With interventions such as the formation of Farmer Producer Organizations, the establishment of Centers of Excellence and seed hubs for Shree Anna (supported under the National Food Security Mission), tribes like the Korku have slowly started to move back towards their traditional food practices. Tribal millets like Kodo (Paspalum Scrobiculatum), Kutki (little millet) and Sawa (Indian barnyard millet) are seeing the light of day in a big way again. You may ask how food can be a part of the cultural heritage of a people. Well, food habits are a basic part of a culture that also serves as a point of emotional association, a channel of bonding or discrimination, while having symbolic references. Millets have been identified as foxtail millet (Priyangava – प्रियंगव), Barnyard millet (Anaava – अनाव), and black finger millet (Shyaamaka – श्यामक) in some of the oldest Yajurveda writings from India. The Yimchunger Nagas of Nagaland celebrate the Metumniu festival in August after harvesting millet crops. People in Vishakhapatnam’s tribal communities celebrate the Mandukiya festival in June-July each year, where bullocks are fed ragi-based food items. After observing Deepotsav (Diwali) or on the sacred day of Nagula Chavithi, it is customary to have ragi pancakes or other recipes. Madiah (ragi), along with turmeric, is still smeared on the bride and groom’s body during wedding rites in Madhya Pradesh. In tribal societies, millet seeds are believed to provide protection against evil spirits. To ensure successful hunting and a plentiful harvest, the Pahadi Korwa tribe of Chhattisgarh hang millet stalks in their courtyards.Post-Independence, the documentation of tribal practices in India faced challenges stemming from a lack of dedicated efforts, resulting in the loss of invaluable cultural knowledge as traditional practices faded away undocumented. Historical biases and a focus on mainstream narratives often marginalized tribal communities, leading to inadequate representation and documentation of their unique cultural practices, languages, and rituals. The absence of standardized methodologies and insufficient collaboration between academic researchers and tribal communities hindered comprehensive documentation, limiting the preservation and understanding of India’s diverse tribal heritage. What we often forget when observing and documenting tribal cultural practices is that more often than not it is us who have to learn a lot from them, as put forth by Jaipal Singh Munda, a member of the Constituent Assembly, in the context of democracy as a socio-cultural and political thought,“You can’t teach democracy to tribals. You need to learn democratic values from them. They are the most democratic community on earth.”The Modi government initiated a comprehensive documentation effort to record endangered tribal cultural practices, languages, and rituals. This policy aims to create a repository of knowledge that can be preserved, studied, and shared to prevent the loss of valuable traditions. The comprehensive documentation effort initiated by the Modi government involves ethnographic research teams collaborating with tribal communities to meticulously record and document endangered cultural practices, encompassing rituals, ceremonies, linguistic nuances, and traditional ecological knowledge. This initiative employs modern technologies such as audiovisual recording, digital archiving, and geospatial mapping to create an accessible and comprehensive repository, ensuring the preservation of endangered tribal cultural practices for academic study, community reference, and future revival efforts. There is still ongoing debate and discussion on whether utilizing remote sensing technologies such as drones and satellite imagery for non-intrusive documentation of tribal culture in India is a possible approach, given international examples such as from Guyana, where members of the Wapichan tribe use Parrot Bebop quadcopters for documenting preservation of important cultural and sacred sites to monitoring land-use patterns. The documentation effort by the Modi government also encompasses partnerships with anthropologists, linguists, and cultural experts, who work alongside tribal members to ensure accurate representation and culturally sensitive portrayal, safeguarding the integrity of the recorded practices while fostering a deeper understanding of tribal heritage. This work has also been facilitated by the `double engine model’ with state governments in BJP-run states such as in Goa, where the Tribal Research Institute was registered under the Societies Registration Act 1860 in January 2023 for better documentation and showcasing of tribal culture in Goa.Under the aegis of the BJP government’s Tribal Cultural Heritage Revival Program, a targeted funding framework was established, channelling resources directly to tribal communities for the documentation, preservation, and revitalization of their endangered cultural traditions. Through this mechanism, tribal groups are invited to submit comprehensive project proposals, outlining specific cultural practices targeted for revival, proposed methodologies, and anticipated outcomes, thus ensuring a focused and strategic approach. The funding allocation process involves an interdisciplinary review panel comprising cultural experts, anthropologists, linguists, and tribal representatives, who evaluate proposals based on criteria such as cultural significance, potential impact, community engagement, and sustainability. Upon approval, the granted funds are disbursed in phases, contingent on achieving predefined milestones, as outlined in the project proposal. This phased disbursement structure promotes accountability, effective resource utilization, and progress tracking. Even the Tribal Sub-Plan, which came into existence in the 1970s for developing areas with tribal concentration, was functional mainly as an accounting exercise without adequate emphasis on the planning and execution of schemes to ensure demonstrable benefits for the scheduled tribes, for decades! The Tribal Cultural Heritage Revival Program allocated a budget of ₹500 crores during its first phase to support various projects aimed at documenting, preserving, and reviving endangered tribal cultural practices. Under this program, over 2,000 traditional tribal festivals and cultural events have been financially supported and promoted, facilitating the preservation and celebration of indigenous rituals and traditions across different tribal communities. The Tribal Cultural Heritage Revival Program has facilitated the establishment of more than 300 Tribal Heritage Conservation Centers across the country, providing resources, technical expertise, and training to tribal communities for the documentation, archiving, and promotion of their cultural practices, languages, and traditions. In addition to financial support, the BJP government has organized capacity-building workshops, technical training, and access to modern tools such as digitization equipment and archival software, empowering tribal communities to execute their revival initiatives efficiently while integrating modern documentation techniques. On the occasion of the Tiranga Utsav on 2 August 2022, Union Minister of Home Affairs Shri Amit Shah released a pictorial book in memory of revolutionary tribal fighters of the Indian freedom struggle in partnership with Amar Chitra Katha.The Modi government has facilitated cultural exchange programs and workshops that bring together different tribal communities to share and learn from each other’s endangered cultural practices. These interactions contribute to the revitalization and cross-pollination of tribal customs. The Union government facilitated a series of cultural exchange workshops, engaging tribal artists and artisans from various regions, allowing them to share and exchange their unique cultural practices, craftsmanship, and traditional knowledge. This was beautifully encapsulated in the words of Indian playwright Mahesh Elkunchwar“Adivasi heritage is a tapestry woven with threads of resilience, wisdom, and cultural diversity that enrich the fabric of our nation.”It has also promoted the work of the Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan and organised the Tribal Youth Exchange Programme for the development of tribal youth with the support of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. The aim of this programme is to provide an opportunity to the tribal youth of 30 selected districts of seven states to visit various places within the country to understand the cultural ethos, language and lifestyles of the people. One key aim of the initiative is to sensitize the tribal youth about their rich traditional & cultural heritage and enable them to preserve it for future generations. This is in conjunction with other existing initiatives such as the Ice Stupa Project Students’ Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh (SECMOL) under the Ministry of Tribal Affairs (Government of India), because of which villagers were able to conserve around 75 lakh litres of water in Ice-Stupas during winters and undertake eco-tourism activities like first Ladakh Ice Climbing Festival that gave the local youth an opportunity to be part of eco-entrepreneurial ventures. The Going Online as Leaders (GOAL) Program, a collaborative effort between Facebook and the Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA), was inaugurated on May 15, 2020, with the ambitious goal of digitally empowering 5,000 youth from tribal communities in India. By enlisting the expertise of 2500 industry leaders and influencers across diverse fields, the initiative aims to provide personalized mentorship to tribal youth, focusing on digital literacy, life skills, leadership, entrepreneurship, and sector-specific expertise. The comprehensive nine-month program encompasses mentorship, skill-building, and practical experience through a two-month internship, fostering holistic development among tribal mentees. There is also governmental emphasis on intergenerational knowledge transfer within tribal communities, with encouragement given to elders to actively teach younger members about endangered practices, ensuring their continuity and relevance.The Modi government has displayed a strong commitment to the conservation and promotion of tribal languages through a series of targeted initiatives. As part of the ‘Eklavya Model Residential Schools‘ program, launched in 2018, over 460 tribal languages are being preserved and taught, ensuring that indigenous linguistic diversity thrives within the formal education system. Furthermore, the ‘Tribal Language Development Program‘, introduced in 2016, focuses on documenting and revitalizing endangered tribal languages. Through this program, a substantial corpus of tribal language resources, including grammatical structures, dictionaries, and literature, has been compiled. Notably, the government’s ‘Bhasha Sangam’ initiative has celebrated linguistic diversity by featuring over 100 tribal languages on digital platforms, fostering greater recognition and appreciation of tribal linguistic heritage. By embracing digital technology, the Modi government has also launched the ‘Tribes India E-Marketplace,’ facilitating the online promotion and sale of tribal literature, art, and crafts, including works reflecting the linguistic nuances of tribal communities. These comprehensive efforts underscore the government’s dedication to preserving and nurturing the linguistic identities of India’s tribal populations. According to the NEP 2020 report, approximately 220 languages have been lost over the previous 50 years. In addition, 197 Indian languages have been listed as endangered by UNESCO. Even certain official languages included in the Indian Constitution’s Eighth Schedule face significant challenges. A facile bureaucratic procedure sometimes serves as a vehicle for the extermination of a language or dialect. The Criminal Tribes Act was enacted by the British Indian government in 1871 and only repealed in 1952. The Act stigmatised and forced some populations, usually nomadic, to hide their cultural heritage and suppress their languages. Following the 1971 Census, the Indian government declared that any indigenous language spoken by less than 10,000 people would be removed from the list of the country’s official tongues. The dialects which have been considered endangered, include seven from Manipur (Langrong, Aka, Koiren, Aimol, Lamgang, Tarao and Purum), three from Odisha (Manda, Parji and Pengo), two from Assam (Tai Nora and Tai Rong), two from Karnataka (Koraga and Kuruba), two from Arunachal Pradesh (Mra and Na), two from Andhra Pradesh (Gadaba and Naiki), one from Uttarakhand (Bangani), one from Maharashtra (Nihali), one from Jharkhand (Birhor), one from Meghalaya (Ruga), one from West Bengal (Toto), two from Tamil Nadu (Kota and Toda) and four from Himachal Pradesh (Baghati, Handuri, Pangvali and Sirmaudi). Languages such as Ghallu, Helgo, Adhuni, Dichi and Katagi have gone extinct. The Union government under the leadership of Minister of Education Dharmendra Pradhan has initiated a Scheme for the Protection and Preservation of Endangered Languages of India in December 2021 and been working with the Mysuru-based Central Institute of India Languages on the protection, preservation and documentation of all Indian language.The Union government has sanctioned over ₹864 lakh to various universities, institutes and academies for research on tribal medicinal practices and healing traditions nationwide, with the government data revealing that over ₹312 lakh has been allotted to the Patanjali Research Institute in Haridwar. The Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, operating under the AYUSH ministry, has undertaken a commendable Tribal Health Care Research Programme aimed at documenting and preserving the wealth of folk medicines and traditional practices present across diverse regions of India. Implemented through 16 peripheral institutes across the country, Tribal Health Care Research Programme not only collects valuable information but also extends healthcare services to tribal populations. Collaborative efforts with institutes like Itanagar in Arunachal Pradesh and Bangalore in Karnataka involve comprehensive medico-ethno botanical surveys, meticulously cataloguing medicinal flora and indigenous practices. The National Medicinal Plants Board, under its scheme, has similarly sponsored ethnobotanical research projects in states like Assam, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh, delving into the medicinal usage of local flora by tribal communities. The National Medicinal Plants Board’s creation of an accessible database, detailing the therapeutic attributes and habitats of over 7,000 medicinal plant species, stands as a significant resource for preserving and sharing traditional knowledge. Collaborating with CSIR, the Ministry of AYUSH established the Traditional Knowledge Digital Library, a comprehensive repository of codified texts translated into multiple languages, serving as a preventive measure against the misappropriation of India’s traditional medicinal wisdom. Furthering these efforts, the establishment of the North Eastern Institute of Folk Medicine in Arunachal Pradesh aims to safeguard and promote the rich tapestry of folk medicine practices unique to the North Eastern Region. These endeavours collectively reflect a profound commitment by the Indian government to uphold and propagate traditional healing practices while ensuring their rightful recognition and protection. The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today approved the establishment of the National Institute for Sowa-Rigpa in Leh as an autonomous organization under the Ministry of AYUSH in November 2019. Sowa-Rigpa, a traditional medical system indigenous to the Himalayan region, has found widespread popularity and practice in various Indian locales, including Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Darjeeling (West Bengal), Himachal Pradesh, and the Union Territory of Ladakh, now extending its influence throughout the entire country.Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP government has made significant strides in promoting tribal cultural resurgence in India. Through various policies and initiatives, the government has recognized and empowered tribal communities, encouraged the revival of traditional arts and crafts, preserved tribal languages, promoted festivals, improved educational facilities, and safeguarded tribal medicinal knowledge. The efforts made by the government have not only preserved the cultural diversity of India but also empowered tribal communities to actively participate in the nation’s growth and development. However, there is still much to be done to ensure that the tribal cultural heritage remains vibrant and thriving for future generations. It is imperative for the government and society as a whole to continue supporting and preserving the unique cultural identity of India’s tribal communities. The resurgence and safeguarding of tribal culture enable the restoration of traditional knowledge systems, such as Ayurveda and Sowa-Rigpa, which challenge the dominance of Western medicine and contribute to the decolonization of India’s healthcare practices. The revival of tribal cultural practices, such as the Dokra metal craft and Warli painting, helps counter the erasure of indigenous art forms caused by colonial influences, fostering cultural diversity and decolonizing artistic expressions. The resurgence of tribal culture also aids in decolonization by reinforcing land rights, as exemplified by the Forest Rights Act of 2006, which recognizes and restores tribal communities’ historic rights over forest lands, challenging colonial-era dispossession. The revival of tribal cultural practices fosters eco-friendly cultural tourism, as seen in the case of the Konkan Railways’ “Tribal Village Tourism” initiative, promoting economic growth, community well-being, and decolonization of tourism narratives. The story of Bharat is a story of its indigenous identity and heritage, and by reclaiming the narrative on Bharatiyata with an autochthonous renascence of its tribal components, we can build a truly decolonized discourse for a civilizational resurgence, in our bid to become a Vishwa Guru again.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

35,"13 October, 2023 ",Lessons from Hamas’ attack on Israel: The fake ‘Genocide of Muslims’ narrative in India will be used to justify Genocide of Hindus as ‘language of oppressed’,"Hindus need to be far more worried than Israel because the nations that stand with Israel today would not stand with Hindus when the barbarians come knocking at the door - which they do almost on a regular basisRight before dawn 5 days ago on a Saturday, Israel woke up to her worst nightmare. As the sirens blared and citizens of Israel looked for shelter, a couple of thousand Islamic terrorists from Hamas attacked the bewildered civilians from air, sea and land. As thousands of rockets and missiles rained down on Israel leaving in its wake destruction and a trail of dead bodies strewn on the streets, hundreds of terrorists on motorbikes, on foot and followed by tractors breached the fence separating Israel from Gaza. Simultaneously, terrorists also attached the beaches of Israel riding on motorbikes, overwhelming the unsuspecting Israeli soldiers. As the embers and smoke engulfed Israel, some of the Islamic terrorists descended on paragliders. After descending on Israel, the terrorists went city to city, village to village and kibbutz to kibbutz hunting down women, children and men alike. The visuals from the assault could perhaps be classified as traumatising, but worlds fall short when the Jihadi barbarity is laid threadbare, captured in images of charred bodies, burnt babies, raped and dishonoured women, and bloodied and murdered men. Several Jews were taken hostage by the terrorists as they cried and screamed for help, amidst the chants of Allahu Akbar, they were beaten, spat on, dishonoured and kidnapped – carried at the back of their trucks to Gaza. The wound of seeing babies bloodied and murdered is one that Israel and the Jewish community would perhaps never be able to heal from. From babies who slept peacefully in their cribs to partygoers dancing their worries away, where 260 of them were slaughtered, the Muslim terrorists spared none. Amidst the scent of death and blood, the wails of tragic loss, the cries for help and the screams of rage, Israel rose as one. Several Israelis travelled back from wherever they were in the world to seek justice – to seek retribution. Old, young, men and women got called into duty – to defend the civilisational home of the Jews and to ensure those who had the blood of children and women on their hands paid a price for their barbarism. Israel then began to pound Gaza with rockers and missiles, flattening whatever stood in its path. On the 13th of October, Israel asked 1.1 million Palestinians to move from the North to the South – the instruction included for UN officials and those hiding in their premises to relocate as well – signalling that Israel was ready for a ground assault. Israel has also shut down the water and electricity supply of Palestine. Israel pleaded with the world – don’t look away. Look at the biggest onslaught against Jews since the Holocaust. Look at what the Islamic terrorists have done. They have killed our babies. Raped our women. Beheaded our sons. They want us gone – annihilated – murdered – humiliated. Don’t. Look. Away – they pleaded. They pleaded because they knew that as a country that fights for its very survival everyday will not be cowered down and that retribution will be theirs. As expected, when Israel started responding to Palestine’s mass violence against Jews, the narrative was not too kind to them, despite the fact that most countries which often gloss over Islamist violence came out vehemently in support of Israel – USA for example. Almost immediately, the narrative shifted to the brewing humanitarian crisis in Palestine with Israel shutting off its water and electricity supply. In one video, the former Prime Minister of Israel screamed – What is wrong with you? We are fighting the Nazis. How can you expect us to give water and electricity to our enemies”. 'Are you seriously asking me about Palestinian civilians? What is wrong with you? We're fighting Nazis.'Former Israeli PM Naftali Bennett adds 'if Hamas use anyone as a human shield, it is their responsibility.'https://t.co/PAiZ4D1jU3📺 Sky 501 pic.twitter.com/19nBKjOYOQThe media, however, continued what it does best – whitewash the crimes of Muslims and blame the victims of violence of genocide when they choose to stand up and say – ‘Thus far and no further’. The essence of these articles was simple – Israel is committing a genocide of Palestinians by way of its retaliatory action after Jews were raped, murdered, beheaded or injured. They were careful – though. They were careful to also give a “context” to the Palestinian attack against Israel. In an article headlined, “Palestinian Americans, Dismayed by Violence, Say Historical Context Is Being Overlooked”, The New York Times essentially provided context to the mass murder of rape of Jews by Islamic terrorists. The article said, “In interviews with more than a dozen Palestinian Americans, many said they were saddened by the violence against civilians, both Israeli and Palestinian, and hoped for a peaceful resolution. But many said that the underlying causes of the conflict could be traced to the policies of Israel and the United States, and decades of Palestinians being denied freedom of movement and basic rights”. The subtle agenda-pushing is a work of art that must be fully appreciated. In the article, the New York Times essentially pushes the narrative that Palestinians are lovely people who are very very… very sad about the “loss of lives” in Israel. They are empathetic and don’t support terrorism of any form. However, they are also terribly sad that the USA and perhaps the rest of the world are not understanding the historical context of why these lovely, peaceful, delightful people from Palestine raped, beheaded and tortured Jews in Israel. In turn and as a result, while it was the Jews who got raped, beheaded and tortured, it was the Palestinians who were the real victims not only because Israel launched a counteroffensive against them but also because the barbaric, Islamophobic world was refusing to understand why the Palestinians were forced to murder babies, rape women, behead civilians and torture/murder the men. Further in the New York Times article, another Palestinian is quoted saying the following: “These statements are really dehumanizing us,” she said, “and telling us that our lives are not worth anything.” In the eyes of those officials, she added, “we are never the victim, we are always the aggressor.”This statement was made in response to US’ support to Israel and statements demanding action against Hamas for their misadventure. But do you see what happened here? While the entire article asserted that the Muslims were the victims whether they were killing Israelis, facing retaliatory action or celebrating the murder of Jews, the Palestinian quoted here craftily plays victim to negate the incontrovertible fact that Islamic terrorists are indeed the aggressors. While these op-eds try to paint the Islamic terrorists as “Gandhis with guns”, they gloss over the fact that Gaza has been officially ruled by Hamas since 2017. They gloss over the fact that it is not just Hamas – Palestinians take to the streets to celebrate atrocities against Jews on a regular basis. They gloss over the fact that they may attempt to differentiate between Hamas and civilian Palestinians, but even the civilian Palestinians don’t differentiate between the state of Israel and average, civilian Jews because in the Hamas onslaught, celebrated by Palestinians and Muslims across the globe, those killed were average Jews, average Israelis – women, children, elderly. When we look at the incidents in Israel, this is what the apologists want the world to believe. Interestingly, there is an uncanny parallel to how the world arm twists Hindus every time they come under the attack of Islamists. The parallels of the narrative being crafted post-Hamas violence in Israel and the narrative which is crafted every single time Hindus come under the assault of Islamists have several parallels and lessons that Hindus can draw. While Hamas burnt alive Jewish victims in Israel, Dilbar Negi’s hands and legs were chopped off and he was burnt alive by Islamists in India just 3 years ago. The narrative has been eerily constant regardless of established facts – whether we discuss the partition horrors against Hindus or the current aggressions against Hindus. In this regard, it would bode well to remember the case of Mahashay Rajpal, who published Rangeela Rasool and was ultimately assassinated for it. We mostly hear that Mahashay Rajpal was assassinated for publishing a satirical work on Prophet Muhammad called Rangeela Rasool, but we seldom hear why he chose to publish the book. In 1923, Muslims published two particularly offensive books to Hindus. “Krishna teri geeta jalani padegi” used derogatory and vulgar language against Shri Krishna and other Hindu deities and “Uniseevi sadi ka maharshi” which contained derogatory remarks on Arya Samaj founder Swami Dayanand Saraswati (incidentally written by an Ahmadi).In response to this provocation by Islamists, Pandit Chamupati Lal, a close friend of Mahashay Rajpal, wrote a short biography of the Islamic Prophet, Mohammed. “Rangeela Rasool” was a short pamphlet which satirised the life of the Prophet of Islam. Pandit Chamupati made Mahashay Rajpal promise that he would never reveal the name of the author – he knew the consequences of it. Anonymously published under the name “doodh ka doodh aur panee ka panee”, the book enraged Muslims. Staying true to the values of one-way brotherhood, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi wrote in his pamphlet “Young India”, condemning Rangeela Rasool. While Gandhi ignored the provocation by Muslims, by the end of June 1924, the colonial government banned the book. The Muslim community, partly emboldened by MK Gandhi’s endorsement of their hurt sentiments and whitewashing of the provocation against Hindus, filed multiple cases against the book under 153A. In May 1927, Mahashay Rajpal, who published the book, was acquitted of all charges with the court observing that commentary based on facts on historical figures, including the prophet of Islam, cannot be said to promote enmity between groups. As soon as the verdict was delivered, Muslim mobs went into a frenzy. They rioted and demanded the head of Mahashay Rajpal. They were chants about how the murder of Rajpal was acceptable because, under Sharia, the punishment for blasphemy is death.On April 6th, 1929 a 19-year-old carpenter named Ilm ud din stabbed Mahashay Rajpal on his chest eight times while he was seated in the outer verandah of his shop. Though he was offered to give up the name of the author, Pandit Chamupati Lal, during the court proceedings, he refused and did not yield. He paid the price for it. He paid the price for publishing that book despite the court acquitting him and the Muslims getting a special law to protect their fragile feelings. Before Mahashay Rajpal was murdered brutally, the Muslims got their way and got 295A passed by the British, which aimed to protect their ever-outraged feelings. In this case too, it was the Islamists who mounted the initial onslaught by publishing books insulting Hindus. It was the Hindus who published one book in return. The response to that was the Muslims going on a rampage, rioting, committing violence and beheading Mahashay Rajpal. Through it all, it was the Hindus who were condemned by MK Gandhi while the Muslims, who indulged in violence, became the eternal victims getting a law to protect their feelings. Any conversation around this subject, till date, conveniently glosses over the Muslims publishing the two books first and their rampant violence later – what is remembered is that Hindus published a book that hurt Muslims and that Hindus are the community that must be blamed for the murder of Mahashay Rajpal because the Muslim hurt was justified. Not too long after India was torn apart by those who were convinced that the Muslim community could be placated. Before the Rangeela Rasool controversy, Hindus saw the Khilafat movement, and the support it got from Congress and Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and after that, Hindus saw the rise of a Muslim leader like Mohammad Ali Jinnah, leading India’s partition.16th August 1946 was the day when the call to massacre Hindus of Bengal was given by Muslim League founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah. Bengal, the only province in India under Muslim League rule at that time, was apparently chosen by the Muslim League leadership as the suitable place to unleash terror on Hindus in the name of “Direct Action”.In 1946, the massacre of Hindus in Bengal was rather intricately planned. Jinnah is recalled having said that he would either have India divided or India burnt and that he had given up on Constitutional methods to demand the creation of Pakistan. Jinnah had chosen the 16th of August as Direction Action Day because it was the 18th day of Ramzan, the day when the Battle of Badr was fought and won – a war fought by Prophet Muhammad himself, against the Kaffirs, and is considered to be won by Allah’s divine intervention by Muslims. The battle led to the violent occupation of Mecca. On the 16th of August, Calcutta was littered with posters lionising Jinnah and reminding Muslims that they had to follow the footsteps of the Prophet. It is reported that Syed Muhammad Usman, mayor of Calcutta, had issued a widely circulated leaflet that said: Kafer! Toder dhongsher aar deri nei! Sarbik hotyakando ghotbei! (Infidels! Your end is not far away! You will be massacred!). The aim was to make Bengal ‘land of the pure’ and rid it of the Kaffirs (Hindus). The aim was to wage another Battle of Badr, in which the Muslims would conquer the heathens. What followed on the 16th right after the Jumma Namaz is Muslims going on a rampage, beheading Hindus, chopping their limbs off and raping Hindu women. Several women were taken as sex slaves by those who were fighting with the religious fervour of the Battle of Badr. In the Kesoram Cotton Mills at Lichubagan in the Muslim-dominated Metiabruz area, Muslim mobs entered and beheaded over 600 labourers. The Hindus, neutered and asked by Gandhi to die with a smile on their face hardly fought back. There was a mass exodus from Bengal that marked millions fleeing because the massacre seemed too brutal to fight against.When Gopal Patha rose to defend the Hindus, it was MK Gandhi who asked him to lay down his weapons. The retaliatory, self-defence action by the Hindus were deemed the original onslaught and the openly religious violence against the Hindus were pushed under the rug to ensure that the Muslims continued to be the universal and eternal victims. Despite the historical atrocities committed by Muslims against Hindus, today, the Media goes no overdrive trying to push the narrative that there is an impending genocide against Muslims that the world is waiting to witness in India. Reams are written on how Hindus harbour animosity against the Muslims, depriving them of their legitimate rights, lynching them, killing them and humiliating them – building up to a genocide – much like that committed supposedly by Israel against Palestine. History and the current onslaught have been systematically whitewashed by historians, scholars, politicians and the corporate media – to an extent that the world has failed to see the realities of the Hindu population. Let us take the Nuh violence recently for example. Thousands of Muslims had descended on Hindus travelling to an area where the dominant demography was of Muslims. they were travelling there to simply worship Lord Shiva on an auspicious day for Hindus. They were pelted with stones, their cars burnt, held hostage inside the temples where the hostages included women and children and attacked with bullets, acid pouches and petrol bombs. Through it all, the narrative was that somehow, it was the Hindus who had provoked the violence because a) they dared to take out a religious procession in an area where Muslims predominantly live after ghettoizing the area and driving Hindus away and b) because of a rumour that a Hindu activist that the Muslims don’t like might be present at the procession – a lie which was spread by the Islamists themselves. Here is how Le Monde wrote about the Nuh violence. First, they turned one-way violence by the Islamists into “violence between Hindus and Muslims” simply because after the one-way violence, the Hindus had decided to defend themselves. Then, they blamed Hindu organisations for “genocide” and “terror” because they dared to speak about the violence and asserted that they would not accept attacks against Hindus. See a pattern with what is happening in Israel? The Islamists unleash violence. Their violence is justified as the language of the oppressed. When Jews decide to defend themselves and retaliate, they are called the aggressors and the terrorists who unleashed violence continue to be the victims, with the real victims being blamed for unleashing hate and genocide simply because they chose to defend themselves. After the brutal beheading of Kanhaiya Lal by two Muslims who then uploaded the beheading video on social media, holding the blood-dripping knife, global media blamed Hindus for asserting that their lives matter too. Here is what the TIME published. At the very onset, author Mansoor shifted the discourse from the beheading of Kanhaiya Lal to supposed ‘chilling calls for revenge’ against the ‘marginalised’ Muslim population. While trying to contextualise the murder of Kanhaiya Lal, Sanya Mansoor suggested that the poor Hindu tailor had drawn the wrath of the Islamists upon himself by supporting the ‘derogatory comments’ of ex-BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma. Meanwhile, Mansoor also tried to shield the co-religionists of the killers and praise them for their token condemnations. “Muslim politicians and Islamic preachers swiftly condemned the killing,” she asserted while conveniently ignoring their collective silence over calls of ‘Sarr tan se juda chants all over India backed by the same people.Do you see the parallels? Here they are: When a Muslim gets lynched because he was a thief and primarily for such reasons, the media and the global world order are quick to call it an onslaught against Muslims by Hindus, however, when Hindus are lynched, beheaded, raped and murdered for explicitly religious reasons amidst the chants of Allahu Akbar, the Hindus have been historically blamed for the violence by the Muslims claiming that the Muslims are indulging in violence because the Hindus have somehow enraged them enough to go on a justified murderous rampage. To prove their point, they even invent crimes where they claim Muslims were beaten up amid Hindu religious slogans simply to justify crimes against Hindus amid chants of Allahu Akbar. They’re lies, screamed from the mountaintops versus our truths meekly repeated, with nobody to listen to us – that is the battle that Hindus have been fighting for millennia. History shows that progressively, a violent minority has strengthened the legislative, judicial and societal cover it gets to assert its religious supremacy aspirations. These aspirations are often negotiated after a violent, vehement and shameless assertion of street veto. The State and leaders who are meant to protect Bharat have bent a knee to the street veto and tried their damndest to assuage the perennially offended, the often violent and the perpetually demanding lot. Their constitutional special status keeps getting reaffirmed either by politicians or the judiciary in the hopes that the ever-so-offended lot will not take to the streets and indulge in rampant violence which the state is woefully incapable of controlling simply to prove just how downtrodden and oppressed they truly are. The intolerant minority has often held a sword to Hindus’ neck and forced us to concede that we have oppressed the sword-wielders.In this bargain, the global world order and the media has followed the pattern of demonising the victims of Islamic violence – the Hindus – and paint the aggressors – the Islamists – and the perpetual victims. In the case of Israel, we see large acceptance of their persecution and acknowledgement of her right to retaliate. Even then, the narrative demonising the Jews for fighting for their survival and civilisational identity is strong enough to spark violence and protests against the victims. Hindus have failed to do what the Jews have done spectacularly well – make the world aware of their own genocide, and their own persecution and ensure that normalisation of that hate is not only a punishable offence but one for which the society itself might ostracise you. We saw that play out after Hamas’ attack against Israel – those students from Harvard who blamed Israel for the terror attack against Jews by Islamic terrorists were forced to retract their statements because corporations started pulling away their job offers. The USA – which when it comes to India whitewashes the Islamic terrorists, was grieved and stood firmly behind Israel’s right to self-defence. The Muslim nations that wanted Israel wiped out mostly stood by mute because they knew the world stood by Israel and her right to self-preservation. As Israel flattens Palestine, there is recognition to some extent that the Jews, especially after suffering from the horrors of the Holocaust, will not stand by and get wiped out again. In India, however, partly because of the failure of Hindus themselves and the systematic whitewashing of history and news by scholars, political leaders and the corporate media, wails of persecution often go unnoticed. In fact, they don’t just go unnoticed, the narrative that we see media, Islamists and Leftists build against Israel today, is a constant against India with other players supporting Israel today joining in as well. Hindus need to be far more worried than Israel because the nations that stand with Israel today would not stand with Hindus when the barbarians come knocking at the door – which they do almost on a regular basis – because our own leaders are a part of the narrative demonising Hindus. Take Rahul Gandhi for example and how he today shields Islamists by calling IUML secular, endorsing calls to wipe out Sanatan Dharma, seeking foreign intervention to stop the Hindus and a caste census back home to divide the persecuted. The world will look away as Hindus get slaughtered and the narrative being crafted will blame Hindus for their own persecution and genocide, claiming that the violence unleashed by the Islamists is the “Language of the oppressed” – they are doing that today with Israel – but it would be far easier to do it with Hindus because, unlike Israel, we have traitors amongst ourselves and a world that has normalised persecution of Hindus after we failed to talk about our own plight for centuries. Today, far more than ever, Hindus need to learn from the Jews. Bharat needs to learn from Israel. If we don’t talk about our own persecution – nobody will. If we don’t protect our honour – nobody will. If we don’t stand up to our murderers being painted as the victims – nobody will. And if today we don’t realise the threats of Islamic terror and how it comes even for those who weep for the self-proclaimed marginalised Islamists today. The Hindus’ collective right to retain the cultural, religious and ethical integrity of the only land they have has to be held sacrosanct – legislatively, judicially and socially. This is, perhaps, the one lesson that Israel can teach us – that history is screaming out, waiting for Hindus to hear. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

36,"10 October, 2023 ","There is no common brotherhood, only ‘common enemy’: How the Ummah ignores millions of Muslim victims but gets together against Jews, Hindus, and Christians","There has been a shocking outpouring of support for Hamas around the world. Thousands of Muslims, regardless of their ethnicity and nationality, have gathered in the streets of Western nations, where they enjoy the privileges of democracy and freedom of expression, to declare open support for the brutal slaughter of women, children, and hundreds of unsuspecting civilians.Since Israel declared war following the Hamas terrorist attacks and ground invasion, the majority of the Arab world has rallied in support of Palestine. These countries have a long history of supporting the “Palestinian” cause. However, their support doesn’t stem from the perceived notion of religious fraternity and common brotherhood, colloquially referred to as the concept of Ummah instead it is driven by the hatred for dehumanised non-believers, pejoratively called ‘Kafirs’ (infidels) and shared theological believe of a common enemy. Conspicuously, the responses of the Arab world vis-a-vis alleged atrocities on Muslims by non-believers as against that of Muslims on Muslims underscores the exploitative and preposterous concept called “convenience of victimhood” to serve the end goal of justifying the ‘annihilation’ of non-believers. Here are some antecedents revealing how support for Palestine or Muslims being ‘persecuted’ around the world serves as just a tool to usher in Dar-ul-Islam and make the world ridden from infidelity.  Israel-Palestine neighbours Syria, Egypt, and Jordan among others have fought wars citing the cause of Palestinians, however, they all share a dark history of persecuting Palestinians on their soil or mercilessly committing crimes against the population, which they allege Israel commits against Palestinian Muslims. Evidently, on 17th September 1970, Jordan carried out a massacre of thousands of Palestinians which is notorious as ‘Black September’ for Palestinians. Fifty years ago, King Hussein ordered the Jordanian Army to massacre militants in the refugee camps situated around Amman. Following the royal orders, the Jordanian army launched a brutal crackdown in a bid to retake control of territory occupied by the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) in Jordan.  According to the 2015 census data, there are around 634,000 Palestinians in Jordan out of the total population of 9.5 million. However, Human Rights organisations claim that half of the Jordan population is Palestinian. The ruling Hashemite dynasty of Jordan fears the large population of Palestinians in the country has the power to destabilise the empire.Meanwhile, Pakistan has a deep interest in supporting the Palestinian cause which increased, especially after India started strengthening its relationship with Israel in the 1990s. However, Pakistani leaders have avoided discussing this chapter in Palestinian history: the events of Black September in Jordan in 1970. Notably, Pakistan played a major hand in exterminating Palestinian ‘terrorists’ hiding in refugee camps. Jordan had sought the assistance of Pakistan to train its newly equipped army. As a result, the critical training for the Jordanian army was provided by Pakistan.Another neighbor, Syria which earlier used to mollycoddle Hamas, it acted against Palestinians when they exploited and aggravated civil war in Syria, the nation which was hosting them. Apparently, Syria used to host Hamas leadership, but it had a fallout with Syrian authorities after the Palestinian refugees participated in the 2011 uprising that preceded the Syrian Civil War. However, normal Gazans or Palestinians didn’t share the same fate as their top brass for participating in the Syrian Civil War. While the Hamas leadership was just shunned from the country, ordinary Palestinians (despite hailing from the Muslim faith) were brutally hacked to death. According to private data gathered by the Action Group for Palestinians of Syria (AGPS), they documented the death of at least 4,013 Palestinians as a result of the war in Syria. The victims included 614 refugees who had died of torture inside Syrian regime prisons and detention centres and 205 who had died due to lack of medical care and the tight siege imposed by the Syrian regime army on the Yarmouk camp in Damascus, the AGPS had revealed. Israeli politician Golda Meir once famously said, “We will have peace with the Arabs when they love their children more than they hate us”. The same does not just apply to Islamic countries, it also applies to Hamas (Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya) which uses the civilian population of Gazans to materialize their hatred for Jews.Notably, Hamas has been using civilian sites like hospitals, religious sites, or educational institutions to launch rocket or missile attacks and exploit civilians as cannon fodder. The Israeli Defence Forces demonstrated an example of a religious site that was hit by the Israeli Air Force as it was used by Hamas to launch a terror attack on Israel.Israeli civilians are not Hamas’ only victim.Hamas intentionally positions itself deep among Gaza's population. For example…this terrorist site that the Israel Air Force targeted, located next to a mosque and just a football field away from a school. pic.twitter.com/ROs3iMdnLzThe Rafah Border Crossing, also known as the Rafah Crossing Point, serves as the sole crossing point between Egypt and the Gaza Strip. It is located on the Gaza–Egypt border, which was recognised by the 1979 Egypt–Israel peace treaty. However, Egypt has a long history of prohibiting Gazan refugees from entering its territory to avoid its negative security implications. Cairo which has suffered the brunt of Islamic State (IS) or Daesh, has feared infiltration of Hamas terrorists in the guise of Palestinians, particularly Gazan refugees. Even today, soon after the Hamas terrorists imposed an unprovoked war on Israel, Egyptian security closed this sole border crossing for Gazans. The reports of it were confirmed by the Israeli officials who had earlier asked the Gazans to cross over to Egypt in the wake of its retaliatory strikes on Hamas terror sites. However, later they had to clarify that the Rafah crossing was open yesterday, but now it is closed.BREAKING: Egypt has closed the Rafah crossing with Gaza's southern borderThe Rafah border crossing has remained predominantly closed since Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in June 2007. Even when Egypt makes some concessions, it only allows those who require medical treatment or have foreign residency permits to cross the borders, a move targeted toward Hamas terrorists. Do you know why #Egypt doesn't open the #Rafah border crossing with #Gaza to let 2.3 million Palestinians living there flee? This is because 8 out of every 10 Palestinian men living in #Gaza are terrorists or terrorism supporters! For years, Egypt has suffered from #ISIL/#Daesh,… pic.twitter.com/zD0C89d7pAStrikingly, the Egyptian fear revolving around the entry of Hamas terrorists in the guise of Gazan refugees stems from the fact that Hamas has in the past targeted the Rafah border and Egyptian border personnel including blowing it up with explosives. One such incident was reported on 23 January 2008, when Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip set off an explosion near the Rafah border crossing, destroying part of the 2003 wall.Meanwhile, Israel had already sealed its border crossings with the Palestinian enclave, allowing in only humanitarian aid and basic supplies which have been cut post the 7th October Hamas terrorist attack on Israeli citizens.Earlier, Hamas used to amass funds to the tune of $12 million per month from taxes on Egyptian goods imported or smuggled into Gaza through tunnels. Notably, Gaza shares a 12 km long border with Egypt on its south and Rafah is the sole border crossing. However, in 2013, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi assumed power. Since then, Cairo has ended Hamas’s operation as it asserts that Hamas is an extension of the Muslim Brotherhood, which is again a dreaded and designated terrorist organisation.  Afterward, the Egyptian military closed down the majority of tunnels that were crossing into its territory. This action took place during their campaign against a faction affiliated with the self-declared Islamic State on their side of the border, within the Sinai Peninsula. Recently, Jordan implemented a policy that can’t be further from the concept of “Common brotherhood” or the antithesis of catering to the Ummah brotherhood. Evidently, Jordan which was perceived as a host accepting millions of Palestinian, Iraqi, and Syrian refugees on the lines of the Universal Muslim Brotherhood, had taken a hard turn. Experts have pointed out that the “Jordan Initiative” unveiled in May will radically change Jordan from one of the world’s most accommodating hosts to one of its biggest proponents for sending refugees home. Regarding this, deputy director of the Middle East and North Africa division at Human Rights Watch, Adam Coogle said, “Jordan long has said that refugees are welcome. But now the official rhetoric has moved toward supporting their return. It’s a cause for significant concern.”Similarly, Lebanon and Turkey have speeded up the deportation of hundreds of Syrians, their Muslim brethren, since April to speed up their exodus from their so-called “pro-Ummah” nation.  Likewise, Pakistan, the vociferous proponent of Ummah, has recently asked millions of Afghan refugees to leave the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Afghan refugees who had fled their nation when the Taliban took over Kabul and had been living in Pakistan have been reportedly given only four weeks time to return, forcing them to choose between the brutalities of two co-religionist nations, Pakistan or Afghanistan.  On the basis of Ummah, persecuted Muslim citizens/refugees of war-torn Yemen should have garnered the same support as they have been suffering from a brutal war, starvation, and cholera that have been ruining lives. However, this is not the case because co-religionists are involved in this war and there is no “convenience of victimhood” involved in the Yemeni conflict to furtherance the cause of Dar-ul-Islam or fighting/killing the infidel. There is a war in Yemen, there is a war in Syria, there is a war in Sudan, and there is a war in Lybia. Muslims are killing Muslims in all these wars, thousands of victims, did you see any protests in New York, London, Berlin, ..? Why?Because for many Muslims they do not really…The same goes for Syrian, Sudanese, and Libyan refugees, Muslims being persecuted by terrorism in Africa and elsewhere, attract no whispers of support as they don’t have the binding clue – common enemy. Islamic nations like Pakistan, Iran, Turkiye, Palestine, Lebanon, etc have committed sins on their own native Muslim sects – Ahmediyas, Balochs, and Sindhis etc in Pakistan, Hamas killing dissenting Muslims and Fatah leadership, etc. Fighting for common brotherhood, persecuted Muslims and atrocities, and ethnic cleansing in Muslim countries by Muslim leadership have always been brushed under the carpet.     Instead, the outcry for atrocities is targeted at non-believers for causing hindrance to their dehumanising and Jihadi acts –reflected in the anti-Semitic, anti-Hindu, anti-Western (Christ-believing countries) calls, like “Gas the Jews”, asking Pakistanis to kill ‘Hindus’, death to Israel and “death to America” in the Iranian parliament.  Palestinian Islamic Scholar Nidhal Siam's Anti Hindu speechAnd they're Supporting Palestine pic.twitter.com/fdsQQGgs0hThe latest hatred towards the “common enemy” is clear from the fact that the Arab world has refrained from condemning the propensity of crime committed on innocent Israeli citizens. On 7th October, Hamas terrorists launched a war involving rocket barrages and ground invasion into Israeli territories killing unsuspecting Israelis and other foreign nationals present in their sight. In the catastrophic invasion of Israel, more than 700 Israeli citizens have lost their lives, hundreds of children, girls, and the elderly have been taken hostage with Hamas terrorists giving open threats to behead them and air the beheadings, rape being used as weapons of war, bared and bruised bodies of women being paraded in streets. Conspicuously, these assaults were inflicted on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah and the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.There has been a shocking outpouring of support for Hamas around the world. Thousands of Muslims, regardless of their ethnicity and nationality, have gathered in the streets of Western nations, where they enjoy the privileges of democracy and freedom of expression, to declare open support for the brutal slaughter of women, children, and hundreds of unsuspecting civilians. Be it Australia or Canada, the UK or the USA, the Palestinian cause has seen overwhelming support. However, the same people have never stood for the millions of malnourished children in Yemen, they never cared for the little girls deprived of schooling in Afghanistan, or the Muslims victimized by terrorists in Africa. The global Muslim population conspicuously lacks concerns for legitimate human rights abuses and atrocities when the perpetrators are their own people. It only unites when the enemy is the “other”, the Jew, the Hindu, or the Christian. Simply put, they just want to see the end of non-believers, one excruciating death after another and Jews had always been the first in line followed by Hindus and Christians with rejected/outcasted Muslim sects like Ahmediyas in between. Iran’s fanatism to have nuclear power demonstrates that it just wants to destroy the Jewish state and to achieve that it is ready to spend dozens of Gazas and Palestinians and Lebanon etc. The first hallucination of the usage of nuclear arsenal will be on Israel, taking away the existence of their beloved Palestinian Muslim brethren, for whom such wars are claimed to be fought for and such brutality are being justified.    Meanwhile, in the non-Arab world, leaders from across the world, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden have expressed their solidarity and support for Israel at its difficult hour. It wouldn’t be wrong to say that Common victimhood has become a tool, while common brotherhood is just a blatant lie, the only thing that unites the Muslim world, in general, is the hatred of the ‘common enemy’ – Israel, followed by Hindus and Christians with outcasted Muslim sects in between.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

However, in the party's flag, there is a yellow olive leaves symbol and the words 'Welfare Party' in the middle panelAs Israel continues its military action against Hamas in Gaza in retaliation to the horrific terror attack on Israel by Hamas, Islamists and leftists worldwide, who are traditionally anti-Israel, are protesting against Israel and in support of Hamas and Palestine. A similar protest march in support of Palestinians was taken out by the Kerala-based Welfare Party of India in Kerala on Friday, 20 October in Palakkad in Kerala.However, when the photos and videos of the protest started appearing on social media, people started mocking the Welfare Party of India, saying that it was carrying the flag of Italy instead of the flag of Palestine.

This is because they were carrying neither the Italian flag nor the Palestinian flag, they were carrying the flag of their own party.The flag of the Welfare Party of India has remarkable similarity with the Italian flag, as both the flags are made of vertical panels of green, white and red. However, there is a difference.In the Italian flag, all three panels are blank, but in the WPI flag, there are design elements in the white part in the middle. It has the olive leaves symbol in yellow and the words ‘Welfare Party’ written vertically in black inside the white panel.As the videos shared by the social media users are of low resolution, the yellow leaves symbol is mostly not visible against the white background. But parts of the words ‘Welfare Party’ in black are visible in some of the flags if the videos are observed carefully.Moreover, in other images and videos of the protest posted by the party and others, it is clearly seen that it is the party flag, not the Italian flag.In the video posted in the tweet below, which has better resolution, the yellow leaves symbol and black letters saying ‘Welfare Party’ are clearly seen in the flags carried in a pro-Palestine march by the party in Kozhikode.#Gaza_Genocide#IndiaWithPalestine: Massive rally in Kozhikode, Kerala – India by welfare party of India Kerala against #Israel's atrocities in #Palestine!Hundreds join in solidarity with #Gaza, chanting slogans like '#FreePalestine' and 'Stop #Gaza_Genocide'! pic.twitter.com/qE3ElKVkacTherefore, while the Welfare Party’s support for Palestinians is questionable given the horrific terror attack on Israel, the party didn’t make any mistake in picking the flag for the protest.

38,"13 October, 2023 ",Did a Hamas supporter accidentally set himself on fire while burning the Israeli flag? Know the truth behind the video which has gone viral,"The video is an old one from 2021 and the incident happened during the Al-Quds Day protest that was carried out in Iran in May that year.The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas has resulted in mass genocide, killing over 1300 Israelis and injuring hundreds more. As the Israel-Hamas war rages, a video went viral which showed a man unintentionally lighting himself on fire while burning an Israeli flag.The video has been widely shared on X since yesterday (October 12), with most of the users alleging that it was a Hamas supporter who attempted to burn the Israeli flag amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. They mocked the Hamas supporter saying that Karma paid him back. An X user @Hariindic shared the video with the caption, “Look at the current situation of Hamas – Hamas supporter accidentally set himself on fire! Karma works wonders.”#Hamas situation right now😂🇮🇱🇵🇸 WATCH: Hamas supporter accidentally sets himself on fire! Karma acts in wonderful ways.#Israel #IsraelPalestineWar #HamasMassacre #GazaUnderAttack #HamasTerrorism #Gaza_under_attack #HamasTerrorists #Palestine #GazaUnderAttack #Gaza pic.twitter.com/4pNnGgG6CbIn the footage, a man is seen holding a massive Israeli flag. Another man approached the man who was holding the flag and set it on fire. Within seconds, due to the direction of the wind, the clothes of the man who is holding the flag also catch fire. The man immediately drops the flag on the ground and scampers away after his clothes catch fire. Amusingly, the group of protestors who were seen standing beside him holding Palestinian flags, instead of coming to his rescue, quickly moved away from him to save themselves from the fire.Though the video was being shared extensively on X, formally Twitter, OpIndia decided to do some investigation, after which we learned that the video was an old one that resurfaced in the midst of the recent Israel-Hamas confrontation. Even in 2021, the same video was shared by numerous social media accounts. The majority of these accounts belonged to Muslim people who had posted the video to express their hostility towards Israelis.خداوندا مارا از دست پیروانت نجات بده.God, save us from your followers pic.twitter.com/T3xGT5ImJyIn fact, the Times of Israel reported about the incident in May 2021. The media report shared the same video posted by several X users then, claiming that the video was from the Al-Quds Day protest that was carried out in Iran on May 7 2021.Let us inform you that in 1979, the year of the Islamic Revolution, Iran established Al-Quds Day, or Jerusalem Day. The Iranian government marks the day with anti-Israel rallies, demonstrations, and threats to “liberate” Jerusalem from Israeli rule.In conclusion, despite the fact that the video has recently gone viral amid the ongoing Israel and Hamas war, it is an old one from Iran and does not feature any Hamas supporters or terrorists. Though here too, the Israeli flag was burnt in a show of sympathy for Palestine and a show of anger against Israel.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

39,"7 October, 2023 ",Fact Check: Did 121 people die because of the shutting down of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi,"Earlier in September this year, the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi came under the scanner over the death of a 22-year-old woman named Divya Shukla. Days after the Allahabad High Court stayed the suspension on the licence of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi, social media was rife with disinformation about the death of 121 people in the Munshiganj area of the city.On Friday (6th October), a propaganda news outlet by the name of ‘4 pm’ interviewed an alleged employee of the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital, who made outrageous claims about the death of 121 patients due to lack of medical attention.An alleged nursing staffer by the name of Saurabh Mishra claimed that a whopping 121 residents of Amethi died due to the closure of the hospital. “Some are dying en route to Lucknow, others are not getting medicines on time. There are not even cotton swabs and bandages,” he claimed “Around 121 patients have died in just 15 days,” Mishra continued. “This is the politics of vengeance…They (BJP) hate Gandhis,” he brazened out. Prior to him, another alleged employee of the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital named Umashankar Pandey claimed that the licence of the medical facility was suspended due to the BJP’s disdain for the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty.“Smriti Irani (MP from Amethi constituency) hates the fact that ‘Gandhi’ name is attached to the hospital. Now, they (BJP) are hurting the employability of small-time workers,” he was heard as saying. After the clips of the video went viral online, the Congress system exploited the opportunity to create hysteria about the supposed death of more than 120 people in Amethi.It must be mentioned that the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi is run by the Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Trust (SGMT), which is headed by Congress supremo Sonia Gandhi.Congress loyalist Shantanu claimed, “In hate of Rahul Gandhi and the Gandhi family, @smritiirani and the BJP govt of Uttar Pradesh took lives of 121 people as the functioning of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital was stopped…” He later deleted his tweet.flesh alive passed the sell by date.The max sucking power of her throat and lungs it's all down hill from here,1.6 B Indian slaves being treated like animals.Shame on dirty Indian politics/politicians.Feku &Gang should be hanged, not worth living on planet earth.Sooner the betterOther propaganda artists also shared the claims about the death of 121 patients. On Friday (6th October) night, the District Magistrate & Collector of Amethi, Rakesh Kumar Mishra, rubbished the false claims being propagated on social media.एकदम भ्रामक एवं गलत बात कही जा रही है। किसी की मृत्यु नहीं हुई हैं। जनपद अमेठी के सभी सरकारी चिकित्सालयों में दवा आदि की कोई कमी नहीं है। तथ्य के विपरीत जनस्वास्थ्य के बारे में अफवाह फैलाने के विरूद्ध वैधानिक कार्यवाही की जाएगी ।“Completely misleading and wrong things are being shared. No one has died. There is no shortage of medicines in any government hospital of Amethi district,” he informed. “Legal action will be taken against spreading rumours about public health contrary to facts,” the District Magistrate of Amethi warned.Earlier in September this year, the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi came under the scanner over the death of a 22-year-old woman named Divya Shukla. The victim went into a state of coma after being administered anaesthesia, prior to a kidney stone operation.Shukla was then referred to Medanta Hospital in Lucknow, where she eventually passed away. The district administration ordered the closure of the hospital, citing medical negligence, and directed the suspension of OPD and emergency services. A case was also registered against 4 employees of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital for negligence. On Wednesday (4th October), the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court put the order of the district administration on hold and directed the resumption of services.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The video which quickly went viral showed a person resembling cricket legend Kapil Dev, who had his hands tied and mouth strapped being manhandled and taken away by two goons. Cricketer turned politician Gautam Gambhir shared the clip on X, formally Twitter as he enquired about the World Cup-winning captain’s well-being. However, as soon as the video went viral, netizens started flooding Gautam Gambhir’s timeline hoping that it was a promotional stunt similar to what happened last year with cricket pundit Harsha Bhogle.Sharing the video Gautam Gambhir wrote, “Anyone else received this clip, too? Hope it’s not actually @therealkapildev and that Kapil Paaji is fine!” along with a fingers-crossed emoji.Anyone else received this clip, too? Hope it’s not actually @therealkapildev 🤞and that Kapil Paaji is fine! pic.twitter.com/KsIV33DbmpIn the 0.07-second clip, a man in a light blue t-shirt and checkered trousers is seen being carried away by two goons. The man, who resembles Kapil Dev, has his wrists tied behind him and his mouth strapped with a piece of cloth. The man turns around for a fraction of a second, revealing his face. He offers a helpless look as the two men drag him inside a dingy house.While no official statement has been issued regarding the viral video, numerous followers on social media have claimed that it is nothing more than a promotional gimmick. Advertisment lol😅😅No one falls for it nowMany Netizens reacted angrily, slamming the ad firm for the lame video and praying and hoping for the cricket legend’s well-being and safety. These ex cricketers are selling themselves for ad money. Some are selling gutkhas while others are doing these cheap ads. ShameSeeing Kapil Dev kidnapped in a viral clip is worrying every cricket fan. Hoping it's fictional, not real crime. If just an attention-grabbing ad, the creators should apologize for causing such distress irresponsibly.#KapilDev #ResponsibleMarketing https://t.co/WwmRLauk1pDisgusting way for viewership, atleast respect our legends 👍Some were quick to recall a video from last year that showed cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle abruptly disappearing while speaking to a sports portal via video link. Just as it was eventually revealed that Harsha Bhogle’s video was a promotional gimmick, many Netizens were convinced that this was a re-run of last year’s act.It looks like an ad.. Hopefully it is They did this earlier with Harsha too.A similar video that had left Netizens worrying, had emerged in March 2022, wherein cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle suddenly disappeared while talking to a sports portal via video link. Harsha Bhogle was talking to cricketsportwalkin on an Instagram live session on March 24, 2022, when suddenly he disappeared from the screen after the camera apparently fell to the ground with a blurry image. However, later it was revealed that it was a promotional stunt that went wrong, as people started genuinely worrying about him.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

41,"19 October, 2023 ","Israeli guest gets upset after Indian anchor wears saree with colors of Palestine flag, Netizens divided: Misplaced symbolism or just her grandma’s saree?","Shreya Dhoundiyal responded to the 'allegation' by saying that the saree she was wearing belonged to her grandmother and that she had not worn it deliberately. ""Let's not divide colors on the basis of religion.. sometimes it happens in India also. This saree does not signify any support to any side,"" she said. On Thursday (18th October), journalist Shreya Dhoundial on the Mirror Now channel was slammed by an Israeli guest in an ongoing debate for wearing clothes that allegedly showed the colors of the Palestine flag. Shreya, who is an Executive Editor for Mirror Now, was seen wearing a Green silk saree with a red border and a black blouse. The Israeli official invited for a live debate highlighted that the journalist was wearing the colors of the Palestine flag, indirectly extending support to Hamas terrorists. The video of the incident was shared by the journalist on Twitter (X), who said that her ‘grandmother’s old saree’ had upset the Israeli guest during the live debate. “My Dear Departed Grandmother’s Saree Upset My Guest From Israel This Evening. For Once I Was At A Loss Of Words,” she tweeted. My Dear Departed Grandmother's Saree Upset My Guest From #Israel This Evening. For Once I Was At A Loss Of Words. 👇 pic.twitter.com/uxaEWiqUzaThe Israeli official from the Israel Intel special forces identified as Fredric Landau slammed the journalist and said that she was deliberately wearing the saree to extend support to the terrorist organization from Palestine. “And I can see the colors that you are wearing this evening and that’s why I am purposely wearing blue and white. Because with all due respect, the green, the red, and the black which you are purposely wearing this evening, blue and white will always prevail,” Landau said. Shreya Dhoundiyal responded to the ‘allegation’ by saying that the saree she was wearing belonged to her grandmother and that she had not worn it deliberately. “Let’s not divide colors on the basis of religion.. sometimes it happens in India also. This saree does not signify any support to any side,” she said. However, Landau shut her up by indicating that she should stop making stories. “Save it for identification,” he could be heard saying.It is notable here that the Palestinian flag has the colors black, white, and green in strips, and a red triangle. Shreya was wearing a silk saree with green and red colours with a black blouse. The video of the incident has gone viral over social media with netizens also ‘alleging’ that the journalist was wearing the saree deliberately. One of the users said very conveniently the journalist had bought the colors matching the flag of Palestine. Meanwhile, the other one said, “What a coincidence! Your dear departed grandmother’s sari is just like the flag of the guests’ enemy.” Another user further criticized Dhoundiyal for not doing research on the guest before the debate. “Little research would have saved you from loss of words. As a journalist, research on the subject and interviewer is basic stuff. Either research was not done or it was actually done and a specific dress was worn to give a subtle message. Nowadays, interviewers do research on journalists and they are well prepared to call it out,” he said. On the other hand, many others, including Alt News co-founder Mohammed Zubair, Rohini Singh extended support to Shreya Dhoundial for wearing the saree with colors green, red, and black on it. Zubair shared one of Shreya’s old tweets in which she could be seen wearing a similar saree. However, the colors wore then by her in her attire included Purple, Red, and Green and not Black, Red, and Green which are the colors used in the flag of Palestine. Fact Check : https://t.co/7QT1OqKLxIThe ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine marks the most devastating single incident with the terrorist organization Hamas attacking the Jewish state on 7th October and massacring at least 1,300 people.Updating about the Israel-Hamas war, the Israeli military said on 16th October that it has notified the families of 199 people so far that their loved ones are among those who have been held hostages in the Gaza Strip after they were abducted by Hamas terrorists during the 7th October terror attack. The Iranian Foreign Ministry claimed that Hamas ‘potentially’ was ready to release the nearly 200 Israeli and other foreign nationals it has held hostage if Israel stops airstrikes on the Gaza Strip, the Times of Israel reported. However, the terrorist group, Hamas hasn’t acknowledged making such an offer.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

In this story, The New York Times called Hamas ‘terrorists’. However, it replaced the word ‘terrorists’ with ‘gunmen’ after some time, in line with the left-liberal media policy of not using the term terrorist for jihadi terrorists.The news article titled ‘Hamas Leaves Trail of Terror in Israel’ was published on 10th October by The New York Times. In the subtitle of the article, the American newspaper wrote, “As Israeli soldiers regain control of areas near Gaza that came under attack, they are finding evidence seen in videos and photos and confirmed by witness accounts of the massacre of civilians by Hamas terrorists.”After some time, The New York Times changed the last word in the sentence ‘terrorist’ to ‘gunmen’. The NYT was called out on social media for calling terrorists just gunmen in order to score Islamoapologetic secular credentials. American journalist Greg Price wrote, “Holy shit you can’t make this up. The New York Times published a story referring to Hamas as “terrorists” and then changed it to “gunmen”.” Greg Price also shared the screenshots of the news before and after the change.The archive of the report shows the term ‘terrorist’ used by NYT before it was replaced.🚨Holy shit you can’t make this up.The New York Times published a story referring to Hamas as “terrorists” and then changed it to “gunmen.” pic.twitter.com/zp7vQUrHn3Interestingly, while the original report used the term ‘terrorist’ in the subtitle, it was used only once in the report, while the word ‘gunmen’ was used throughout the report. The publication has not replaced the lone occurrence of the term terrorist in the report, which appears in the second paragraph. The word ‘gunmen’ appears 8 times in the report text, sometimes called ‘Palestinian gunmen’ or ‘Hamas gunmen’. There is no mention in the report that Hamas also fired over 5,000 rockets into Israel, many of which hit civilian areas after overwhelming Israel’s air defence system Iron Dome.Referring to the 9/11 terrorist attack in the USA, Greg Price also wrote, “Untold pain suffering was caused by the amateur pilots on 9/11.”Untold pain suffering was caused by the amateur pilots on 9/11.Another X user with handle ID @WithRitesh posted, “Learning from their brothers across Atlantic!

This is Left Media! pic.twitter.com/SBduohHT95Syzmon Thomas posted, “Our media is contemptible and morally bankrupt. I am glad they are slowly, but surely, going the way of the newspaper.” He also added a screenshot of news by the Washington Post calling ISIS terrorist Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi an ‘austere religious scholar’.

It has repeatedly provided a platform for Islamic bigotry. In April 2021, NYT published a news article that said that the onus to convert is on non-Muslims in case of an interfaith marriage involving a Muslim and a non-Muslim.The New York Times is also notorious for its anti-India anti-Modi agenda. In March 2023, the New York Times published an article written by Anuradha Bhasin, the Executive Editor of The Kashmir Times who criticized PM Modi’s stance against the Indian media and its freedom of expression. Donning an anti-India outlook on the international media platform, she alleged that the Modi-led government had imposed ‘repressive’ media policies in the country and was deliberately targeting the media organizations who chose to voice an opinion against it or the Prime Minister.The Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Youth Affairs, and Sports Anurag Thakur lashed out at the New York Times for this anti-India editorial published on 8th March 2023. Anurag Thakur had said, “We don’t need to learn the grammar of democracy from agenda-driven media.” Now, The New York Times has called the Hamas terrorists as gunmen. The recent Israel-Hamas war started after the State of Israel came under attack by Palestine-based Islamic terror outfit Hamas on Saturday (7th October), resulting in the death of more than 900 Israelis. About 2400 people have been wounded and over 100 still remain in the captivity of the terrorists. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

44,"10 October, 2023 ","Can Israel be a victim when all countries are supporting it: YouTuber Ravish Kumar downplays Hamas terror attack, floats conspiracy theory","Ravish Kumar inquired, “Are these Western nations doing justice (by siding with Israel) or amplifying terror (of Israel) in the name of combating terrorism?”Two days after Hamas launched a terror attack on the State of Israel and killed 800 civilians in the process, Indian YouTuber Ravish Kumar on Monday (9th October) attempted to paint Hamas as the victim.“Whose terrorism should be condemned? Who is the terrorist in this case? There is another question – Who is the victim?”, he resorted to shielding the Palestine-based Islamist terror organisation Hamas.The former NDTV ‘journalist’ suggested that Israel could not be a victim of terror in the ongoing conflict as several powerful Western nations are supporting the Jewish State. Ravish shamelessly defends Hamas TerroristsAsks who is Real Terrorist- Hamas or Israel?Attacks countries supporting Israel of siding with Terrorists.""हमास और इज़राइल में किसके आतंकवाद की निंदा होनी चाहिए?”""बड़े देश शक्तिशाली इज़राइल का समर्थन कर आतंक का साथ दे रहे हैं” pic.twitter.com/F4bauFaBN8“We have seen an interesting nomenclature in several writings – one is being called a victim (aka Palestine) and another is dubbed as the victim of victims (aka Israel)… Both of them are accused of terrorism and both are victims…Powerful Israel, accused of occupation (in Gaza) is also a victim,” Ravish Kumar claimed. The former ‘scribe’ made a case for Hamas by claiming that the terror organisation in Palestine is not as ‘powerful’ as Israel. “Now imagine the flight of those who are weak (in front of Israel)…Most nations are with Israel and it is still the victim of ‘victims.’ Not even a handful of countries are with Palestine,” he brazened out.In a bid to pacify his large follower base of Hamas sympathisers, Ravish Kumar inquired, “Are these countries doing justice (by siding with Israel) or amplifying terror (of Israel) in the name of combating terrorism?”“एक महीना पहले, नेतन्याहू को जनता का समर्थन नहीं था।सवाल पूछा जाना चाहिए कि हमास अंदर कैसे आ गया, और इसका जवाब इज़राइल के जवाब में मिलेगा”रवीश घूमा-फिरा के बता रहे हैं कि हमला करवा कर नेतन्याहू अपनी सरकार बचा रहे।सिर्फ रवीश ऐसी घटिया सोच रख सकता। pic.twitter.com/1oWiFlBb0RLater in his monologue, the YouTuber insinuated that the Benjamin Netanyahu-led Israeli government orchestrated the attacks on its citizens for political mileage. “Even a month ago, Netanyahu did not have this level of popular support…Should we leave this question out as to how Hamas intruded into the border of Israel? I am sure the answer to this question…” he cast aspersions on Israel instead of questioning Hamas terrorists.Ravish Kumar made the contentious remarks during his 39-minute-long rant on his YouTube channel on Monday (9th October).Similar claims were earlier peddled by ‘journalist’ turned politician Prashant Kanojia, who alleged, “Elections in Israel are going to take place soon. The current Israeli Prime Minister is also a coward like the Prime Minister of another nation. He also wants to attack his own citizens and win elections.”This is not the first time that Ravish Kumar has resorted to whitewashing extremists, responsible for widespread violence. In August 2020, he tried to absolve the radical Islamists of their complicity in the Bengaluru riots.In his usual sober voice, which helps propaganda sound seamlessly soothing, Ravish claimed on Friday, “Jo dangai hota hai vo dangai hota hai. Na toh unha Hindu mazhab see koi matlab hota hai na hi koi Muslim mazhab see koi matlab hota hai (A rioter is a rioter. He has nothing to due with Hindusim or Islam.)”Ravish further claimed, “Rioters look for a reason to be provoked. Those who know this game plan are well acquainted with the fact that a post can attract mobs who will unleash.” Through his claims, Ravish tried to deny the ‘communal angle’ in the Bengaluru carnage. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

45,"9 October, 2023 ","Former Indian Express journalist Irena Akbar floats conspiracy theory, claims that deceased Shani Louk wore bikini and was not stripped by Hamas terrorists","It could be possible that when she was killed, she was wearing a bikini or other skin-exposing garment,"" the former Indian Express 'journalist' said.A day after Hamas terrorists stripped a German woman and paraded her dead body on a pickup truck, former Indian Express ‘journalist‘ Irena Akbar came out in defence of the terrorists on Sunday (8th October) morning.In a tweet, she wrote, “The woman, whose body was being taken in a pick-up truck, has been identified as Shani Louk, a German-Israeli dual citizen who was reportedly attending a music festival. First, this is NOT an etiquette of war in Islam to attack women, and hence this is condemnable.”The ex-scribe put out a token condemnation over the death of Louk only because ‘attacking women during war’ is supposedly against the tenets of Islam. Then, she proceeded to suggest that the victim was not stripped as she was not ‘fully naked.’One would have to suspend disbelief to believe what this woman is defending here. But, it is par for the course. Don’t underestimate the cruelty of the women of the barbaric cult. They are assigned various roles. One is the defence of a murder, the other is grooming in the… pic.twitter.com/ig50LljpwI“The woman is not fully naked, as parts of her upper & lower body are covered. If you check the Instagram account of Shani Louk (@shanukkk), you would see pictures she posted of herself wearing bikins or other skin-exposing outfits,” Irena Akbar brazened it out.She claimed that the victim could have been ‘partially naked’ at the time of her killing and not necessarily stripped by Hamas terrorists. “It could be possible that when she was killed, she was wearing a bikini or other skin-exposing garment,” the former Indian Express ‘journalist’ said.“…I am being factual here, based on evidence from her own Instagram account where she would post pictures of herself in such clothes. So, it cannot be ruled out that Shani (with all due respect to her) was wearing a bikini or other similar garment when she was killed or captured,” she further alleged.Irena Akbar wrote, “And hence, it is possible that she was NOT stripped by the Hamas militants. However, as Islam prescribes modesty for women and men, and respect for the dead, the militants should have covered her body with a cloth or sheet, and treated it respectfully, or not attack her at all.”She then resorted to mental gymnastics and asked why people, who hail bikinis as a symbol of ‘freedom’, are raising concerns about seeing a woman’s uncovered body. The ex- Indian Express ‘journalist’ conveniently glossed over the fact that the victim was murdered, stripped and paraded by Hamas terrorists.“So, let’s be fair before jumping to outrage, or celebration. Also, I have a question for non- Muslims: You often share pictures of bikini- clad Iranian women on beaches before the Islamic Revolution of 1979. You lament that the women were “free and liberated” in Iran before Shariah law was adopted,” Akbar remarked.“You use the bikini as a symbol of freedom and liberation for Muslim women of Iran, and you contrast that with the hijab, a symbol of “oppression” under Iran’s mandatory hijab law. So, why do you have a problem when Shani Louk was possibly wearing a bikini (when she was sadly captured)?” she brazened out.“Why do you have a problem when her almost-naked body could be publicly seen? Are you again using a woman’s uncovered body to make a point against Palestinians, and Muslims?” the former ‘scribe’ concluded.In April 2021, Irena Akbar stirred the hornet’s nest by thanking Allah for the Coronavirus pandemic. She claimed “If it weren’t for Covid, Indian Muslims would’ve been in detention camps. I’m NOT being grateful for the virus which killed my aunt, sent my dad to the ICU & is causing tragedies across homes. I’m stressing the fact that while fascists were making their plans, God was making His.”“It’s between the devil & the deep blue sea for IMs. Either die/live in fear of Covid OR die/live in fear of anti-Muslim state violence. At least the former doesn’t specifically target us & the public will eventually question the state. But in latter, the public would rejoice it,” she added.In February 2020, she asserted that Dalits should never be trusted by the Muslim community. The Islamist claimed that the Dalits were the ‘foot soldiers’ when communal riots broke out in Gujarat in 2002 after a Muslim mob engineered the Godhra train carnage.“They did the dirty job of gang-raping and killing Muslims. I have never trusted them. They are ill-treated by their upper-caste Hindu brothers, not by Muslims. We owe them nothing,” she wrote. Irena Akbar also called for boycotts of business establishments run by Hindus. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

46,"19 October, 2023 ",Ram Mandir: 51-inch Balswaroop idol to be handed over to the Temple trust by 31st October,"The Ram Lalla idols are being made based on the sketch of internationally acclaimed artist Vasudeo Kamath. He hails from Karnataka’s Karkala town and his paintings from the Ramayana series are acclaimed worldwide.The decades-long wait of Hindu devotees is going to end in January 2024. The construction work of the Bhavya Ram Mandir at Ram Janmabhoomi is progressing rapidly. In May, the Ram Janmabhoomi temple trust announced that three sculptors are making the Ram Lalla statue to be placed in the Garbhagriha. A member of one of the three teams, Vipin Bhadouriya recently informed that the 51-inch tall Balswaroop idol will be handed over to the Ram Janmabhoomi Temple trust by 31st October. Bhadouriya asserted, “The statue of Ramlalla, which will be placed in the sanctum sanctorum of Ayodhya’s Ram temple, is almost complete and will be handed over to the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust by 31st October.” Bhadouriya has been working around the clock with his mentor, Ganesh Bhatt, who is an eminent sculptor from Karnataka. Regarding Ramlalla’s idol, Bhadouriya noted, “Our idol made of black stone will be the world’s most beautiful statue of Lord Ram, more beautiful than what was imagined. The beauty of the idol would leave people mesmerised.” He further highlighted that the idol depicts a balswaroop Ram, as a five-year-old, standing on a lotus, carrying a bow in one hand and an arrow in the other. Additionally, the statue would also have fine carvings and designs. All signs related to Lord Ram are carved on the statue which will be 51 inches tall.Bhadouriya added, “I am happy that our efforts have yielded some good results. Our work is on the verge of completion. After some finishing touches, the idol will be handed over to the trust by the end of this month.” However, he is not the only one who is preparing the Ram Lalla idol. In May, General Secretary Champat Rai said, “The construction work of the idol of Ram Lalla has started. Dr Ganesh Bhatt from Karnataka, Satya Narayan Pandey from Jaipur, and Arun Yogiraj from Karnataka are making idols at three different places on three different stones.” #WATCH | Ayodhya, UP: The construction work of the idol of Ram Lalla has started. Dr Ganesh Bhatt from Karnataka, Satya Narayan Pandey from Jaipur, and Arun Yogiraj from Karnataka are making idols at three different places on three different stones. It is expected that the idol… pic.twitter.com/0PBCgjXbP0According to the Trust officials, the finest Ram Lalla idol would be placed in the ‘garbhagriha’, while the remaining two would be placed in another temple. The Ram Lalla idols are being made based on the sketch of internationally acclaimed artist Vasudeo Kamath. He hails from Karnataka’s Karkala town and his paintings from the Ramayana series are acclaimed worldwide.Meanwhile, out of the three sculptors, two — Bhadouriya and his mentor Bhatt, and Arun Yogiraj from Mysore – have used ‘Krishna Shila’ (black stone) from Karnataka to carve the Ram Lalla idol. Krishna Shila is found in the vicinity of Karkala, a small town in Karnataka, approximately 60 kilometers away from Mangalore.According to the officials, the most attractive and durable sculptures are made with Krishna Shila as it is one of the finest stones used for sculpting. A trust official said, “The stone, weighing 10 tonnes, 6 feet wide, 4 feet thick, and almost one foot long, was specially brought from Nellikaru village in Karkala, almost a month ago.” Whereas the third team comprising Satya Narayan Pandey and his son Shilpi from Jaipur is carving the Ram Lalla statue from ‘A-class’ stone or marble from Makrana. Regarding the usage of Makrana marble, Officials said, “Makrana marble is used for its durability, translucency and fine grains. It is ‘weatherproof’, as it is resistant to erosion and weathering, which makes it ideal for outdoor sculptures and statues.”However, it is important to note that the trust is not using the two Shaligram stones, weighing 14 and 26 tonnes, which arrived from Nepal on 2nd January, for the construction of the Ram Lalla idol.Regarding this Champat Rai said, “The two Devshilas were gifted to us by Nepal. These stones were calcite and quartzite and were procured from the Gandaki River in the Muktinath area of the Himalayan region. However, after consulting many seers, priests, and experts, the trust decided not to use the Devshila from Nepal. It was a difficult decision to take.” The trust has not yet finalised what will be done with Devshila.Further, the Ram Janmabhoomi Trust officials also elaborated on the procedure that will be followed prior to the consecration (pran pratishtha) ceremony of the idol, in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi would take part, on 22nd January.According to the officials, a grand procession will be taken out through the streets of Ayodhya and the Ram Lalla idol will be placed on a special chariot that is under construction. The trust officials said, “The scholars from Kashi will worship River Saryu and give a holy dip to the idol amid the chants of special mantras and hymns. On the final day, the idol will be installed in the garbhagriha.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

He had reached the Sharda Mata Mandir along with his followers on Rath Yatra from Kishkinda – the birthplace of Lord Hanuman in Karnataka.On 15th October (Sunday), the Sharad Navratri Puja was performed at the newly constructed Sharda Temple which is located in the Teetwal border region of North Kashmir’s Kupwara district, near the Line of Control (LoC).

48,"15 October, 2023 ","Navratri: Festival of women’s power whose religious, cultural, economic and scientific aspects are equally important, read the significance of Garba","Garba is viewed as a representation of the universe and the 27 pores (9 in 3 lines) are interpreted as a depiction of the 27 constellations and each of them has 4 phases through which the number 27 X 4 = 108 is obtained.India is a wonderful country where all occasions and festivals are observed with grandeur. Diverse folk traditions are seen from different regions in this colourful country. The sophisticated and magnificent culture of affluent India is formed through the fusion of many indigenous customs. Sanatana Dharma’s core principle is that we are able to gain fresh knowledge throughout our festivities which offer a rational perspective as well and Navratri is one such event which falls on 15 October of this year. Let us tell you about Navratri’s cultural, religious and scientific significance and explain why it is known as the celebration of women’s power.Cultural and religious significance of NavratriNavratri has a special significance across the country, especially in Gujarat. The worshippers of Goddess Shakti observe a nine-day fast and play Garba during the nights. Many consider Garba as a form of entertainment which is performed for fun, however, that is not the case. Navratri has a special significance in spiritualism and is dedicated to the worship of Goddess Parashakti. It is not for enjoying and doing Garba and Dandiya only. Garba is but one method of worshipping Goddess Shakti and growing closer to her. The importance of dance has been described in the ancient Vedic tradition. There are numerous paths that lead to God and Garba is one of them. Therefore, it is first and foremost important to understand and accept that the Ras-Garba on Navratri is not just for leisure, but a vital component of our religious and cultural history.Religious history states that a demon by the name of Mahishasura once sat to perform penance for Lord Brahma. He demanded to be immortal after the latter was pleased and told him to ask for a blessing. However, he was directed to seek another one because immortality was against the law of nature. Afterwards, he requested a boon that neither a god nor a demon or a human could kill him and only a woman would be able to end his life which was granted.Mahishasura rose to power over time and eventually began waging war against the gods who fought unitedly against him but were unable to put a halt to his reign of terror after which Lord Shiv and Lord Vishnu were pleaded for assistance. However, it was not possible to defeat the demon because of the boon bestowed upon him. As a result, all of them including Lord Vishnu began to call upon Goddess Adishakti and a heavenly light that emanated from their bodies gave her a physical form.Mahishasura and Goddess Shakti engaged in combat despite the fact that he was destined to die at her hands. The war lasted for nine days and she defeated him on the tenth day and the festival of Navaratri came into existence ever since. Vijayadashami is commemorated after the conclusion of the auspicious nine days to mark the day the ferocious demon was eliminated. Notably, the day is also celebrated as Dussehra because Lord Ram killed demon king Ravan on the same day. Vijayadashami is an observance of the triumph of Dharma over evil.Scientific RelevanceThe scientific value of Navratri is linked to both its religious and cultural significance. The festival coincides with the intersection of two seasons which has scientific merit. There is a sandhikaal (end of one season and beginning of another) during both Navratris of the year. The body’s adjustment to speech, phlegm and bile generally goes through phases of improvement and decline during this time which affects the immune system. This is the reason that nine days are dedicated to chanting, fasting, purification of the body, cleaning, meditation, havan and other practices to prevent multiple illnesses and have a clean environment.Economic ImportanceAnother very significant aspect of Navratri is its fiscal impact. Hindu events also have a substantial economic component. The income of those who create garba and diyas (clay Lamps) begins to rise at the start of Navratri. Garba is a celebration of the festival of goddess that is participated in by all devotees and it provides employment to the people who make earthen pots and lamps.Moreover, the way people dress traditionally during Navratri is also crucial and benefits those who create the outfits. Several people find work through both little and large purchases. People who produce or sell snacks, sweets, fruits and religious items, for instance, have considerable possibilities for work during Navratri. Therefore, it is equally important to take into account the financial implications of the festival.Importance of ‘Women Power’The significance of women power outweighs the religious, cultural and monetary worth of Navratri by multiple factors. Adishakti pervades the atom and governs the whole universe. Feminity or power of women is also a component of the goddess. A person’s strength is their potential and no work is possible without shakti (power) which is of unique importance in the entire world. Hence, it is worshipped in different places in various ways. It’s recognised as power energy by science. It is known as Shakti or even divine energy in the ancient Vedic faith. According to the Rig Veda, the universe in its entirety originated with a singular power and per science the universe is composed of one energy. The power of women brought prominence to the world just as the universe has emerged from the primal power. Therefore, women power is regarded as an expression of Adishakti.Navratri also serves as a celebration of female empowerment. Navratri is also considered dedicated to women power. Girls are worshipped on the day of Durgashtami and Mahanavami on the occasion of Navratri as they are considered to be the form of Goddess Durga. There is a custom of worshipping one to nine girls between the ages of 2 years to 10 years during the festival.The entire cosmos could not have been created without Goddess Durga who is nature and divinity. She is oxygen and completes Lord Shiva. Shiva and Shakti come together to form Ardhanarishvar (lord who is half feminine). Since Navratri is dedicated to women power and respects them. The fast and Durga Puja would be futile if one offends his mother, sister, wife, daughter or another female during this festival. Hence, Navratri imparts the essential message of honouring all women.Significance of GarbaThe word Garba is derived from the Sanskrit word ‘Garbhdeep’. The popularity of playing garba among young people has elevated significantly in recent times. The popularity of playing garba among young people has elevated tremendously in recent times. If we look at the intriguing background of this well-known and fascinating folk dance, we discover that doing Garba was formerly only a tradition in Rajasthan and Gujarat (notably Saurashtra and Kutch). However, it gained popularity and spread to other parts of India. Now, people take part in Garba all around the country. Garba programs are organised in temples and houses. Nine holes are punched into Garba and it is placed in the centre and everyone plays Raas-Garba around it. Nowadays, large Garba festivals are hosted by various organisations in which people participate.The holes represent the shape of the human body while the lamp therein symbolises the flame form of the soul. The former indicates the nine doors of the human body which include the two eyes, two ears, two noses (nostrils), mouth, anus and genitalia. A person’s soul exits their body through any of these openings when they die. A lamp is continuously lit for nine days with the conviction that the self-flame is perpetually ignited.Apart from this, 27 holes are made in Garba in many places, however, the mystery of it is unknown. Garba is viewed as a representation of the universe and the 27 pores (9 in 3 lines) are interpreted as a depiction of the 27 constellations and each of them has 4 phases through which the number 27 X 4 = 108 is obtained. Therefore, it is believed that rotating the Garbi 108 times by placing the Garba in the middle is equal to the virtue of circumambulating the universe.Method and tradition of worshipNine forms of Goddess Durga are worshipped during Navratri. Each day is dedicated to the worship of a different form. The nine manifestations of the goddess are Shailputri, Brahmacharini, Chandraghanta, Kushmanda, Skanda Mata, Katyayani, Kalratri, Maha Gauri and Siddhidatri. Goddess Durga along with her family, based on religious beliefs, rode her Vahan (carrier/vehicle) from Kailash to Earth on the first day of Navratri. It is crucial to invoke the goddess during the Navratri fast. Invocation means inviting the deity into the house for a specific goal or accomplishment. The installation of the Kumbhasthapana or Kalash comes first in the procedure of worshipping Goddess Shakti. It must be installed if one fast for nine days during Navratri and should do the same even on the first or the day of Ashtami. According to the Devi Purana, it is very important to establish a Kalash in the house before worshipping Goddess Bhagavati. It is erected during worship as an image of the goddess’s strength and as a site of pilgrimage. The Kalash is viewed as a representation of wealth, joy and elegance. Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, Lord Shiva and the heavenly mother force all reside in it.The worship of Goddess Shakti can take place in multiple ways and there are numerous methods to do it which comprise yajna-yagya (ritual done in front of a sacred fire), havan (sacred purification ritual), vrat (fast), japa (meditative repetition of a mantra or a divine name), tapa (asceticism, spiritual discipline) and dhyana (meditation) among other things are performed. Chandipath, BhavanyaShtakam and Shakradaya Stuti have a very special significance in Navratri. Yajna is carried out during Navratri at any divine religious place. It is a method in the Vedic tradition that displays a profound mysticism and the culmination of spiritual power.Note: Read the report in Gujarati here.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

50,"20 October, 2023 ","‘Samdhi, bhai, and the jilted ex’: Know what Mahua Moitra is alluding to in her statement that brings a ‘saas-bahu’ style drama to the whole affair"," Cyril Shroff is the Samdhi of Gautam Adani, and Shardul Shroff, who is accused of giving unverified allegations against Adani to Mahua Moitram, is the bhai or brother of Cyril ShroffDays after BJP MP Nishikant Dubey wrote to the Lok Sabha speaker seeking a probe against TMC MP Mahua Moitra accusing her of taking luxury gifts for asking questions in Lok Sabha, things have rapidly escalated for the West Bengal politician. First, it was revealed that Dupey’s allegations were based on information provided to him by advocate Jai Anant Dehadrai, former partner of Mohua Moitra.After that, the statement by Dehadrai appeared in public, giving detailed accounts of the allegations against Moitra. He said that Mahua Moitra received expensive gifts and other benefits from business tycoon Darshan Hiranandani, in exchange for asking questions in parliament targeting Gautam Adani, Hiranandani’s business rival in several sectors.It was also alleged that Mahua Moitra had provided her Lok Sabha portal’s login credentials, allowing him to post questions directly on her behalf. While the TMC MP had denied the charges, things exploded on 19 October, when Darshan Hiranandani himself issued a statement, confirming the allegations. He confirmed that he was given Mahua Moitra’s Parliament login and password to post questions. Hiranandani also confirmed that he had given luxury gifts to Moitra, paid for her holidays and travels, helped her in renovating her house etc.The real estate tycoon said that Mohua Moitra chose to target Gautam Adani to attack Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as there was nothing to target the PM directly. Adding to the allegations, Darshan Hiranandani alleged that Mahua Moitra was getting unverified information from several people to target Adani. He specifically mentioned three names, Sucheta Dalal, Shardul Shroff and Pallavi Shroff. Here, Sucheta Dalal is a well-known journalist, while Shardul Shroff and Pallavi Shroff are advocates.Mahua Moitra has issued a statement in response to Hiranandani’s statement, alleging that he was forced to issue the statement by putting a gun to his head. However, she didn’t refute charges that she had given him her Lok Sabha login ID and password and also didn’t deny getting gifts from him and asking questions based on his inputs. She added that Cyril Shroff, brother of Shadul Shoff mentioned by Hiranandani, is the Samdhi of Gautam Adani, and the two brothers had a bitter separation of the business. Before mentioning this Samdhi and his Bhai (brother), Moitra had also mentioned her ‘jilted-ex’. Here are the concerned persons and their links to the entire story.Shardul Shroff and Pallavi Shroff are lawyers, and they run one of the largest law firms in India, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co. Shardul Shroff is the Executive Chairman and his wife Pallavi Shroff is the Managing Partner of the law firm, and interestingly, they have an Adani connection. Especially, they were in a bitter fight with Shardul’s brother over the law firm, and that brother is a relative of Gautam Adani.Shardul Shroff and his brother Cyril Shroff were managing partners of Amarchand Mangaldas & Suresh A Shroff & Co, a top law firm. However, there was a rivalry between the two brothers over the firm, and they decided in 2015 to split the company. They reached a settlement following mediation and decided that they would split the law firm established in 1917 by their grandfather.The dispute was the result of the will by their mother Bharati Shroff, who had handed over her entire share in the law firm to Shardul Shroff. Shardul Shroff had moved the Delhi High Court seeking implementation of the will, triggering a bitter war between the brothers.However, they finally decided to settle the matter by signing a Family Framework Agreement. According to this agreement, the shares of their mother were divided equally between them. As a result of the settlement, Cyril Shroff chose to not contest the implementation of the will, and Shardul Shroff chose to not go ahead with the lawsuit seeking implementation of the will.Accordingly, Shardul Shroff now runs Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co, while Cyril Shroff runs Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, India’s largest full-services law firm. Now that Darshan Hiranandani has accused Shardul Shroff and his wife Pallavi Shroff of helping Mahua Moitra in the campaign against Gautam Adani by feeding unverified information, it becomes interesting to note that Shardul’s brother Cyril is related to Gautam Adani.Paridhi Shroff is the daughter of Cyril Shroff and his lawyer wife Vandana Shroff. Paridhi is married to Karan Adani, the elder son of Gautam Adani. Therefore, Gautam Adani and Cyril Shroff are Samdhis, the Hindi word for fathers of spouses.Karan Adani married Paridhi Shroff in a high-profile wedding ceremony in 2013, which was attended by several well-known guests including Mukesh Ambani and Anand Mahindra. Paridhi Shroff is also a lawyer and is a partner at Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas.Given the proximity of Cyril Shroff’s family with Adani and also with his brother, it is possible that Shardul Shroff and Pallavi Shroff had obtained information about the Adani group through Cyril’s firm, which then they passed on to Mahua Moitra.Hence, there are several people involved in the story involving the ‘gift for questions’ charges against Mahua Moitra. There is Cyril Shroff, the Samdhi of Gautam Adani, and Shardul Shroff, who is the bhai or brother of Cyril Shroff.There is also a ‘jilted-ex’ in the story, who is none other than advocate Jai Anant Dehadrai, who unfolded the entire scam. Mahua Moitra has described him as her ‘jilted ex’, acknowledging their previous relationship. She alleged that the allegations against her were based on lies of a ‘jilted ex’.There is also a dog in the story, named Henry. Apparently, both Mahua Moitra and Jai Anant Dehadrai are claiming ownership of this pet dog. Dehadrai has alleged that he had bought the dog, and now his ex Mahua Moitra has stolen it.

51,"19 October, 2023 ","Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza Strip: Ideology, activities, and role in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict","Hamas' attack on Israel on 7th October 2023 brought both terrorist organisations on their toes as Israel retaliated with full might. Notably, while Hamas led the multifaceted assault on Israel, which included land, sea, and air components, PIJ took an active part in the assault, taking dozens of Israelis hostage.Harakat al-Jihad al-Islami al-Filastini, which is better known as Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) or the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine, is the second-largest terrorist organisation operating in the Palestinian territories. It primarily operates in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. PIJ came into existence in 1981. It represents a later generation of Palestinian terrorist groups. Founded in the Gaza Strip, the primary goal of PIJ was to “liberate historical Palestine” using armed struggle and by “appealing to the Islamic heritage of the region”.PIJ separates itself from the other earlier generations of Palestinian Islamist groups, such as Fatah and Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), as it is mainly influenced by the Islamist ideology of armed liberation rather than internal reform. The founders of PIJ, particularly Fathi-al-Shiqaqi, were linked to the infamous Muslim Brotherhood. Shiqaqi and others believed reviving Islamic rule over the Holy Land of Jerusalem was essential. Other Islamist groups mainly focused on internal reform rather than the so-called armed liberation. Shiqaqi was assassinated in 1995. PIJ stresses the importance of bringing the Islamic front together to “liberate Palestine” and bring Islamic rule back in the region. It generally rejects the legitimacy of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and refuses to participate in the elections held by the PA. Going against the PA’s efforts, PIJ emphasised bringing the Islamic community together while acknowledging the diversity among the Islamic movements, including Sunni, Shi’a, Salafi, and Sufi. While the world leaders have extended support to Palestine via a two-state solution, PIJ has categorically rejected it and insisted the entire historic region of Palestine should be brought back under Islamic Rule.PIJ started to expand its presence in the early 2000s. During 2000-2005, there was a period of heightened unrest between Israel and the Palestinian movement. PIJ established its significant presence in the West Bank in those years with hubs in Jenin and the Gaza Strip. During that time, PIJ became the second most potent terrorist organisation operating in Gaza after Hamas.After Hamas’s takeover and Israel’s blockade, PIJ pushed Hamas to engage in military activities to resist the blockade placed in Gaza. The pressure imposed by PIJ on Hamas was reportedly so intense that Hamas followed suit and indulged in armed conflict with Israeli forces. PIJ proved its importance in the area and managed to have an indirect influence on the public policy of Gaza under the de facto ruler, which was Hamas.In the early 2010s, PIJ expanded its presence into “social services” in Gaza. The aim was to offer an alternative for Hamas to the people of Palestine. PIJ kept running its propaganda under the curtain of becoming the voice of the Palestinians and increased its visibility, challenging the dominance of Hamas in the region. While PIJ and Hamas were sort of rivals for dominance in the region, as time passed by, they formed an unwritten modus vivendi or an agreement of existing together in the region. This was the period when Israel started to notice the increasing dominance of PIJ and attacked it directly.Israel and the United States both consider Hamas and PIJ terrorist organisations. They both share a common ground when it comes to acting against Israel. There is ample evidence that the two terrorist organisations have collaborated and launched joint operations to coordinate military activities in Gaza. However, there have been reports that they often lock horns, especially when there are calls for de-escalation in conflict with Israel.The United States and Israel have designated PIJ as a terrorist organisation due to its violent tactics and objectives in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. These designations have implications for regional cooperation.PIJ is mainly backed by Iran, which has provided significant funding and weapons to the terrorist organisation, making it an instrument of Iranian policy in the Arab-Israeli conflict. The financial support from Iran has fluctuated over the years, influenced by the PIJ’s willingness to align with Iran’s broader regional interests. Apart from Iran, it also gets support from Syria and the Lebanese terrorist organisation Hezbollah. Tensions between PIJ and Israel have escalated from time to time over the years. There have been several rocket attacks and airstrikes, leading to violent cycles and casualties on both sides. PIJ’s emphasis on military confrontations and its association with Iran have contributed to its clashes with Israel.Palestinian terrorist groups, including PIJ, have been known to launch rocket attacks that sometimes result in harm to civilians and property. Such incidents underscore the challenges and complexities of asymmetric conflicts where innocent civilians are often caught in the crossfire. It is in sync with the latest incident where a malfunctioned rocket fell on a hospital in Gaza.In recent times, Hamas’s attack on Israel on 7th October 2023 brought both terrorist organisations on their toes as Israel retaliated with full might. Notably, while Hamas led the multifaceted assault on Israel, which included land, sea, and air components, PIJ took an active part in the assault, taking dozens of Israelis hostage. The coordination between the two terrorist organisations showed the evolving dynamics of their military aspects and ability to launch attacks inside Israeli territory. Israel and Hamas war entered the 12th day on 19th October. On 17th October, a rocket fell on the Al-Ahli al-Arabi Hospital in Gaza. The local media working in Gaza ran reports based on Hamas’ claims that it was an Israeli rocket and around 500 people died in it. However, as more information came to light, it was clear that the hospital’s parking lot took the hit, and the hospital building was mostly intact. Furthermore, it was revealed that the rocket that fell on the hospital was not shot by Israel but by PIJ, putting the terrorist organisation in the spotlight across mainstream media.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

52,"17 October, 2023 ","High Court allows Raghav Chadha’s petition to review expulsion from his bungalow, asks him to file an application with the city court","Contrary to Chadha's claim, while the court has vacated the April 18 order which directed the Rajya Sabha secretariat not to evict suspended MP Raghav Chadha from the bungalow in question, it does not imply that the AAP MP is innocent or that there was no violation of the rules pertaining to the allotment of official residence to MPs by the House CommitteeOn Tuesday, 17th October, the Delhi High Court allowed Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MP Raghav Chadha’s plea challenging the trial court’s order allowing the Rajya Sabha secretariat to evict Chadha from a Type VII bungalow in New Delhi.Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani stated on Tuesday that the trial court’s April 18 ruling which ordered the Rajya Sabha Secretariat not to evict Chadha stands reinstated. The order, however, stands revived only till the adjudication of Raghav Chadha’s plea seeking a temporary injunction against his eviction from the Type VII bungalow.The court has ordered Raghav Chadha to file an application for temporary relief with the city court within three days and has ordered the trial court to rule on it first in accordance with the law. The court directed the trial court to decide on Chadha’s plea under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 of the Civil Procedure Code or Code of Civil Procedure (CPC).“The appeal is allowed. Holding that A) there was no requirement for the appellant to file an application under 80 CPC to comply with that provision thus the application under 80 CPC is disposed of as infructuous. Directing the appellant to be present in the court within three days of the pronouncement of the judgement with the direction to the trial court to first decide the application under Order 39 rules 1 and 2 & thus to proceed in accordance with the law. In the meantime, the order dated 18/4 shall stand revived till the application under Order 39 rules 1 and 2 is decided by the trial court,” the bench said.Notably, Rule 1 of Order 39– Temporary Injunctions and Interlocutory Orders provides that temporary injunction may be granted wherein it is proved through an affidavit or otherwise that “any property in dispute in a suit is in danger of being wasted, damaged or alienated by any party to the suit, or wrongfully sold in execution of a decree, or that the defendant threatens, or intends, to remove or dispose of his property with a view to defrauding his creditors, or that the defendant threatens to dispossess, the plaintiff or otherwise cause injury to the plaintiff in relation to any property in dispute in the suit,” till further orders in the matter or its disposal.Rule 2 of Order 39 allows the court to grant an injunction to restrain the repetition or continuance of breach by the defendant(s).Soon after the court ruling came out, the AAP MP ‘welcomed’ the court’s decision to allow his plea to review expulsion from the Type VII bungalow he occupies as if he had been vindicated.Taking to X, Chadha in his ‘statement’ regarding the court ruling said, “I welcome the decision of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court to set aside the order of the trial court, which was against me. The cancellation of this allotment was a clear case of political vendetta, aimed at silencing a young, vocal parliamentarian.” The MP also said that opposition voices were being “deliberately targeted”.He claimed that this is not a fight for home or shop but to save the Constitution.Ye makan ya dukan ki nahin, Samvidhan ko bachane ki ladhayi haiIn the end, truth and justice have prevailedMy statement on the Hon'ble Delhi High Court's ruling to set aside the unjust order to evict me from my official residence. pic.twitter.com/fA7BJ2zLYmContrary to Chadha’s claim, while the court has vacated the April 18 order which directed the Rajya Sabha secretariat not to evict suspended MP Raghav Chadha from the bungalow in question, it does not imply that the AAP MP is innocent or that there was no violation of the rules pertaining to the allotment of official residence to MPs by the House Committee, on his part. Notably, the AAP MP from Punjab had on 10th October moved to Delhi High Court against a trial court ruling dated 5th October lifting the stay on its prior stay order on his eviction from his government bungalow located in Delhi’s Pandara Road.Additional District Judge Sudhanshu Kaushik had ruled that MP Raghav Chadha is not entitled to the Type VII bungalow which he currently occupies, thus allowing the Rajya Sabha secretariat to undertake the process to evict the AAP MP.Rajya Sabha MP Raghav Chadha was allocated a Type VII bungalow on Pandara Road in Delhi in September 2022. However, the Rajya Sabha Secretariat annulled the allotment in March 2023 since it exceeded his entitlements as a first-time MP. Subsequently, the AAP MP was allotted an alternate residence.Chadha had challenged the order at Patiala House Court and obtained a stay on April 18th. The Rajya Sabha Secretariat later filed an objection to the stay order, saying that it was issued without providing them with an opportunity to be heard. The court heard both sides and removed the stay order on October 5th. However, the Delhi High Court has now granted Raghav Chadha permission to re-appear before the trial court within three days from October 17th.According to the Rajya Sabha Handbook, which specifies the eligibility criteria for accommodation, Rajya Sabha MPs, who are first-time Members of Parliaments, including Raghav Chadha, are entitled to Type V bungalows or single flats as their official residence. It is mentioned in the Rajya Sabha Handbook that the MPs who were former Ministers of State, Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha, Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha, nominated members, floor leaders of their parties and members who have served at least one term are allotted Type VI bungalows or twin flats.Meanwhile, Type VII bungalows are allocated to MPs who have previously served in the Union Cabinet, or as Governors or Chief Ministers, or as Lok Sabha Speakers.Furthermore, the Handbook stipulates that the House Committee chairperson may make exceptions. Chadha’s allocation of a Type VII bungalow required the approval of the chairman of the House Committee.While Chadha’s counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi has argued that out of 245 sitting MPs in the Rajya Sabha, 115 have been granted accommodation above their ‘default’ entitlement, Additional Secretariat General (ASG) Vikramjit Banerjee appearing for Rajya Sabha Secretariat stated that he cannot demand negative equality over possessing government property.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

53,"15 October, 2023 ","Navratri: Festival of women’s power whose religious, cultural, economic and scientific aspects are equally important, read the significance of Garba","Garba is viewed as a representation of the universe and the 27 pores (9 in 3 lines) are interpreted as a depiction of the 27 constellations and each of them has 4 phases through which the number 27 X 4 = 108 is obtained.India is a wonderful country where all occasions and festivals are observed with grandeur. Diverse folk traditions are seen from different regions in this colourful country. The sophisticated and magnificent culture of affluent India is formed through the fusion of many indigenous customs. Sanatana Dharma’s core principle is that we are able to gain fresh knowledge throughout our festivities which offer a rational perspective as well and Navratri is one such event which falls on 15 October of this year. Let us tell you about Navratri’s cultural, religious and scientific significance and explain why it is known as the celebration of women’s power.Cultural and religious significance of NavratriNavratri has a special significance across the country, especially in Gujarat. The worshippers of Goddess Shakti observe a nine-day fast and play Garba during the nights. Many consider Garba as a form of entertainment which is performed for fun, however, that is not the case. Navratri has a special significance in spiritualism and is dedicated to the worship of Goddess Parashakti. It is not for enjoying and doing Garba and Dandiya only. Garba is but one method of worshipping Goddess Shakti and growing closer to her. The importance of dance has been described in the ancient Vedic tradition. There are numerous paths that lead to God and Garba is one of them. Therefore, it is first and foremost important to understand and accept that the Ras-Garba on Navratri is not just for leisure, but a vital component of our religious and cultural history.Religious history states that a demon by the name of Mahishasura once sat to perform penance for Lord Brahma. He demanded to be immortal after the latter was pleased and told him to ask for a blessing. However, he was directed to seek another one because immortality was against the law of nature. Afterwards, he requested a boon that neither a god nor a demon or a human could kill him and only a woman would be able to end his life which was granted.Mahishasura rose to power over time and eventually began waging war against the gods who fought unitedly against him but were unable to put a halt to his reign of terror after which Lord Shiv and Lord Vishnu were pleaded for assistance. However, it was not possible to defeat the demon because of the boon bestowed upon him. As a result, all of them including Lord Vishnu began to call upon Goddess Adishakti and a heavenly light that emanated from their bodies gave her a physical form.Mahishasura and Goddess Shakti engaged in combat despite the fact that he was destined to die at her hands. The war lasted for nine days and she defeated him on the tenth day and the festival of Navaratri came into existence ever since. Vijayadashami is commemorated after the conclusion of the auspicious nine days to mark the day the ferocious demon was eliminated. Notably, the day is also celebrated as Dussehra because Lord Ram killed demon king Ravan on the same day. Vijayadashami is an observance of the triumph of Dharma over evil.Scientific RelevanceThe scientific value of Navratri is linked to both its religious and cultural significance. The festival coincides with the intersection of two seasons which has scientific merit. There is a sandhikaal (end of one season and beginning of another) during both Navratris of the year. The body’s adjustment to speech, phlegm and bile generally goes through phases of improvement and decline during this time which affects the immune system. This is the reason that nine days are dedicated to chanting, fasting, purification of the body, cleaning, meditation, havan and other practices to prevent multiple illnesses and have a clean environment.Economic ImportanceAnother very significant aspect of Navratri is its fiscal impact. Hindu events also have a substantial economic component. The income of those who create garba and diyas (clay Lamps) begins to rise at the start of Navratri. Garba is a celebration of the festival of goddess that is participated in by all devotees and it provides employment to the people who make earthen pots and lamps.Moreover, the way people dress traditionally during Navratri is also crucial and benefits those who create the outfits. Several people find work through both little and large purchases. People who produce or sell snacks, sweets, fruits and religious items, for instance, have considerable possibilities for work during Navratri. Therefore, it is equally important to take into account the financial implications of the festival.Importance of ‘Women Power’The significance of women power outweighs the religious, cultural and monetary worth of Navratri by multiple factors. Adishakti pervades the atom and governs the whole universe. Feminity or power of women is also a component of the goddess. A person’s strength is their potential and no work is possible without shakti (power) which is of unique importance in the entire world. Hence, it is worshipped in different places in various ways. It’s recognised as power energy by science. It is known as Shakti or even divine energy in the ancient Vedic faith. According to the Rig Veda, the universe in its entirety originated with a singular power and per science the universe is composed of one energy. The power of women brought prominence to the world just as the universe has emerged from the primal power. Therefore, women power is regarded as an expression of Adishakti.Navratri also serves as a celebration of female empowerment. Navratri is also considered dedicated to women power. Girls are worshipped on the day of Durgashtami and Mahanavami on the occasion of Navratri as they are considered to be the form of Goddess Durga. There is a custom of worshipping one to nine girls between the ages of 2 years to 10 years during the festival.The entire cosmos could not have been created without Goddess Durga who is nature and divinity. She is oxygen and completes Lord Shiva. Shiva and Shakti come together to form Ardhanarishvar (lord who is half feminine). Since Navratri is dedicated to women power and respects them. The fast and Durga Puja would be futile if one offends his mother, sister, wife, daughter or another female during this festival. Hence, Navratri imparts the essential message of honouring all women.Significance of GarbaThe word Garba is derived from the Sanskrit word ‘Garbhdeep’. The popularity of playing garba among young people has elevated significantly in recent times. The popularity of playing garba among young people has elevated tremendously in recent times. If we look at the intriguing background of this well-known and fascinating folk dance, we discover that doing Garba was formerly only a tradition in Rajasthan and Gujarat (notably Saurashtra and Kutch). However, it gained popularity and spread to other parts of India. Now, people take part in Garba all around the country. Garba programs are organised in temples and houses. Nine holes are punched into Garba and it is placed in the centre and everyone plays Raas-Garba around it. Nowadays, large Garba festivals are hosted by various organisations in which people participate.The holes represent the shape of the human body while the lamp therein symbolises the flame form of the soul. The former indicates the nine doors of the human body which include the two eyes, two ears, two noses (nostrils), mouth, anus and genitalia. A person’s soul exits their body through any of these openings when they die. A lamp is continuously lit for nine days with the conviction that the self-flame is perpetually ignited.Apart from this, 27 holes are made in Garba in many places, however, the mystery of it is unknown. Garba is viewed as a representation of the universe and the 27 pores (9 in 3 lines) are interpreted as a depiction of the 27 constellations and each of them has 4 phases through which the number 27 X 4 = 108 is obtained. Therefore, it is believed that rotating the Garbi 108 times by placing the Garba in the middle is equal to the virtue of circumambulating the universe.Method and tradition of worshipNine forms of Goddess Durga are worshipped during Navratri. Each day is dedicated to the worship of a different form. The nine manifestations of the goddess are Shailputri, Brahmacharini, Chandraghanta, Kushmanda, Skanda Mata, Katyayani, Kalratri, Maha Gauri and Siddhidatri. Goddess Durga along with her family, based on religious beliefs, rode her Vahan (carrier/vehicle) from Kailash to Earth on the first day of Navratri. It is crucial to invoke the goddess during the Navratri fast. Invocation means inviting the deity into the house for a specific goal or accomplishment. The installation of the Kumbhasthapana or Kalash comes first in the procedure of worshipping Goddess Shakti. It must be installed if one fast for nine days during Navratri and should do the same even on the first or the day of Ashtami. According to the Devi Purana, it is very important to establish a Kalash in the house before worshipping Goddess Bhagavati. It is erected during worship as an image of the goddess’s strength and as a site of pilgrimage. The Kalash is viewed as a representation of wealth, joy and elegance. Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, Lord Shiva and the heavenly mother force all reside in it.The worship of Goddess Shakti can take place in multiple ways and there are numerous methods to do it which comprise yajna-yagya (ritual done in front of a sacred fire), havan (sacred purification ritual), vrat (fast), japa (meditative repetition of a mantra or a divine name), tapa (asceticism, spiritual discipline) and dhyana (meditation) among other things are performed. Chandipath, BhavanyaShtakam and Shakradaya Stuti have a very special significance in Navratri. Yajna is carried out during Navratri at any divine religious place. It is a method in the Vedic tradition that displays a profound mysticism and the culmination of spiritual power.Note: Read the report in Gujarati here.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The development came ahead of Eid-al-Adha after a Swedish court struck down the police’s ban on Quran-burning demonstrations.As a result, the Houthi movement in Yemen banned imports from Sweden. Houthi-run TV channel Al Masirah quoted the trade Minister as saying, “Yemen is the first Islamic country to ban imports of Swedish goods after its violations and desecration of Muslims’ holiest.”He called upon other Islamic nations to ban imports from the Scandinavian country. The Houthi trade Minister also said that imports from Sweden were limited and that the ban had a symbolic value. He also said that it was the least thing that they could do to protest against the burning of the Quran.Earlier in January 2023, Danish politician Rasmus Paludan burnt a copy of the Quran next to the Turkish embassy in the country’s capital prompting Turkey to halt discussions with Sweden about its NATO membership.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

We have specialist officers with knowledge of flags working on this operation to assist with these assessments,” the cops claimed. It must be mentioned that the X user did not make any mention of ISIS and had merely pointed out about the vicious Islamist sloganeering.The Metropolitan police went out of their way to claim that the flag raised at the pro-Hamas rally was not dangerous and that it did not belong to ISIS. Netizens were forced to add community notes to the response of the cops, which negated their attempt to downplay the waving of a jihadist flag.“While the flag is not an ISIS flag, it is known as the jihadist flag used by Al-Qaeda and associated with holy war and a caliphate. In addition, the filmed person explicitly screams “Islamic State”, “Allah curse the Jews”, and “Allah curse the disbelievers” in Arabic,” the community notes read.Just like the Uk’s Metropolitan Police, the Leicester police has been at the forefront of a misinformation campaign that endangered the lives of Hindus in the city, following the Asia Cup group stage match between India and Pakistan on August 28, 2022.In a letter to the Leicester Council of Faiths on August 31 last year, Chief Inspector Paul Allen falsely claimed that a small group of people called for the death of Muslims and Pakistan. He alleged that the provocative slogans were raised in Hindi, indicating that it must have been the handiwork of the Indian Hindu diaspora. “Unfortunately, a small minority of people began chanting in a racially offensive way, calling for (we believe) “death to Pakistan” and “Death to Muslims” In Hindi,” he had claimed initially.His email, the transcript of which has now gone viral on social media, was in reference to a minor scuffle that took place in Belgrave Road of Leicester. The grave assertion made by police chief Paul Allen gave a free licence to Islamists to unleash havoc on the Hindu community.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

On Saturday (21st October), Detroit synagogue president Samantha Woll (age 40) was found stabbed to death outside her home in the Detroit city’s Lafayette Park neighbourhood, east of downtown.

58,"22 October, 2023 ",Canada helping China hunt ‘fugitives’ in the country for decades: Report,"The investigation further found that the Chinese government rewarded Canadian cooperation with ""trade negotiations"", support in combating illegal drugs and facilitating the release of Canadians detained by the Chinese government.On 21st October, a report was published by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) saying the Canadian government has been helping China to hunt “fugitives” for decades. CBC, the public broadcaster for both Radio and Television in Canada, noted that the Chinese government assists Chinese law enforcement agencies in pursuing fugitive Chinese nationals outside China.The report came to light at a time when India and Canada are experiencing a bitter relationship as Canada has over the years failed to extradite wanted Indian criminals living on Canadian soil, including the recently killed Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Notably, Canada has accused India of killing “Canadian citizen” Nijjar on Canadian soil, an allegation that India has categorically denied. The false accusations against India have worsened the relations between the two nations.In its report, CBC pointed out that the revelations about Canada helping China came to the fore during an investigation by CBC’s The Fifth Estate. During the investigation, former Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) operations officer in British Columbia, Calvin Chrustie, said he had received directives from the “highest level in Ottawa” to cooperate with the Chinese officials regarding a “high-profile fugitive in the Vancouver area.” Notably, Chrustie said he declined to facilitate a meeting request sent by the Chinese officials who wanted to interview the alleged fugitive. The aim was to persuade them to return to China “voluntarily” and face prosecution.The investigation further found that the Chinese government rewarded Canadian cooperation with “trade negotiations”, support in combating illegal drugs and facilitating the release of Canadians detained by the Chinese government.Critics argued that due to the cooperation between the two countries, Canada often turned a blind eye to the lack of an independent judiciary and the use of coercion, including torture, in China to gather evidence. As per the legal experts, the reliability of the evidence provided by the Chinese authorities was often questionable.CBC quoted immigration lawyer Lorne Waldman, who expressed concerns over the same. The legal experts pointed out that the evidence provided by Chinese authorities was obtained by questionable means, including torture and successful challenges in Canadian courts.When The Fifth Estate tried to interview Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc over the matter, he categorically denied issuing any statement. Notably, in early 2023, there were concerns about the presence of alleged Chinese police stations in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver. OpIndia published a report on this in October 2022.The report suggested that China was operating “police stations” in several countries, including Canada and Ireland. The informal police stations were set up by Fuzhou police and affiliated with China’s Public Security Bureau (PSB). Three such police stations were found to be operating in the Greater Toronto Area.Reportedly, China has been aggressively pursuing the return of allegedly corrupt officials and economic criminals who found a haven in foreign countries. The operations, known as Sky Net and Fox Hunt, were started by the Chinese authorities in 2014, resulting in the alleged return of thousands of “fugitives” to China. The state television in China often boasts about such returns.However, according to the critics, Canada has reportedly ignored the lack of an independent judiciary and the use of coercion to gather evidence to facilitate the Chinese government in its hunt. Some Canadian officials have interviewed fugitives wanted by China to assess the extent of harassment and threats they face from Chinese authorities.Notably, there is no extradition treaty between China and Canada. The Canadian government often use the immigration and refugee system to remove the so-called fugitives from its soil. Canadian officials present evidence at Immigration and Refugee Board hearings, some of which they receive from Chinese authorities.During the investigation, The Fifth Estate found that the Canada-China cooperation for the fugitive hunt in the past two decades has been tied to other matters significant to Canada. For example, former ambassador Guy Saint-Jacques stated that Canada was willing to cooperate on repatriations in exchange for Chinese government assistance in curtailing the flow of fentanyl into Canada.Interestingly, it was revealed that there were concerns that Chinese officials violated agreed-upon conditions during their visits to Canada. In some cases, Chinese investigators were caught engaging in unauthorised activities. These breaches raised questions about the credibility of Chinese assurances.The Canada-China cooperation to hunt Chinese fugitives dates back to 1999 when Chinese national Lai Changxing sought refuge in Canada. He was tied to a smuggling and corruption case in the Fujian province of China. The matter led to tensions between Canada and China. Lai Changxing was eventually returned to China in 2011 after assurances were made that he would not face torture or execution. However, his prolonged Canadian refugee claim had strained diplomatic relations between the two countries and laid the foundation for ongoing law enforcement cooperation.Other notable names that came up during the investigation included Tao Mi, who might have faced threats and retribution from Chinese authorities after providing statements. Tao Mi had retracted her statement against Lai Changxing. She was reportedly interrogated at the Canadian consulate in Shanghai in the presence of a Chinese security official. A Federal Court Judge deemed the interrogation inappropriate, according to the report.In a statement in September 2023, India’s Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson, Arindam Bagchi, called Canada a “safe haven for terrorists, extremists and organised crimes”. India criticised Canada for its reputation as a safe haven for criminals and emphasised the need for Canada to address the reputational damage. India requested action against criminals and cooperation on extradition requests for over 20 individuals. The statement highlighted India’s concerns about Canada’s role in providing refuge to individuals facing terrorism charges.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

59,"21 October, 2023 ","‘No comments, have nothing to say’: Trinamool Congress maintains distance from ‘cash for query’ allegations against party MP Mahua Moitra","""No comments on this particular issue. We have nothing to say on this issue. All India Trinamool Congress will not say a single word,"" said TMC State General Secretary Kunal GhoshAs Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra’s ‘cash for query’ scam gets exposed more and more every day, her party has maintained a distance from the scandal. On 21st October (Saturday), the TMC declined to comment on the alleged scam involving of its Lok Sabha MP Mahua Moitra. Speaking to ANI, TMC State General Secretary Kunal Ghosh asserted that the party has nothing to say on the allegations levelled against Moitra. Speaking on behalf of the party, he maintained silence on the particular issue. Ghosh said, “..No comments on this particular issue. We have nothing to say on this issue. Regarding this issue, the All India Trinamool Congress will not say a single word. The related person may answer this, not the TMC party.”#WATCH | West Bengal | Allegations of bribery against TMC MP Mahua Moitra: TMC State General Secretary Kunal Ghosh says, ""…No comments…Regarding this issue, the TMC will not say anything… The related person may answer this, not the TMC party…"" pic.twitter.com/uIqFZSeDE1Similarly, another senior TMC leader, on the condition of anonymity, told PTI that Trinamool Congress is unwilling to get into a controversy and thus “will be maintaining distance from it.” However, the TMC has not taken action against her or sacked her from the party either. Another vocal face of the TMC, Derek O’Brein, who has been active on social media and defends even fake news peddlers like party MP Saket Gokhale, has also maintained an eerie silence on this issue. Rather he has been speaking actively on the queer issues. It is important to note that in the past several years, Moitra had been the vocal face of TMC on the national stage but the party has maintained distance from her ever since the cash-for-query allegations were levelled against the TMC leader.Following the development, BJP leader Rahul Sinha asserted that the TMC can’t shrug off its responsibility by distancing itself from Mahua Moitra. He said, “The TMC always tries to shrug off its responsibility whenever its leaders are either arrested or land into trouble. The TMC needs to explain whether it supports Mahua Moitra or not.” Meanwhile, TMC Lok Sabha MP from Krishnanagar, Mahua Moitra has been actively tweeting over the issue claiming innocence in the Mahuagate. In a series of tweets on 21st October, she expressed her frustration over the current allegations against her and made various claims in this regard.However, she didn’t deny taking luxury gifts in exchange for asking questions in Lok Sabha, and also didn’t deny that billionaire businessman Darshan Hiranandani was using her Parliamentary portal account to post questions targeting Adani directly. Instead, she argued that every parliamentarian shares login IDs and passwords with staff, interns and others, asking the National Informatics Centre to disclose the details of the places from where the IDs of all the Members of Parliament were accessed.It is notable that BJP MP Nishikant Dubey said in an X post that Mahua Moitra’s NIC ID was being accessed from Dubai. In an affidavit filed with the Parliamentary Ethics Committee, Hiranandani Group CEO Darshan Hiranandani acknowledged that the TMC MP provided him with her Parliamentary login credentials which he used to ask questions from the central government on her behalf. Darshan Hiranandani is based in Dubai, and his affidavit was also signed in Dubai and was notarised by the Consulate General of India in Dubai. He also said that he had given luxury gifts and other favours to Mahua Moitra.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

However, in the party's flag, there is a yellow olive leaves symbol and the words 'Welfare Party' in the middle panelAs Israel continues its military action against Hamas in Gaza in retaliation to the horrific terror attack on Israel by Hamas, Islamists and leftists worldwide, who are traditionally anti-Israel, are protesting against Israel and in support of Hamas and Palestine. A similar protest march in support of Palestinians was taken out by the Kerala-based Welfare Party of India in Kerala on Friday, 20 October in Palakkad in Kerala.However, when the photos and videos of the protest started appearing on social media, people started mocking the Welfare Party of India, saying that it was carrying the flag of Italy instead of the flag of Palestine.

The protestors were seen carrying a large banner saying ‘Free Palestine’, apart from the flag with green, white and red vertical bands.“Socialist stupidity and Jew hatred are once again proven to be a package deal,” tweeted activist and radio talk show host Charlie Kirk.Thousands of members of the Welfare Party in Kerala, India march with Italian flags mistaking then for the Palestinian flag, while holding letters that read: “Free Palestien”Socialist stupidity and Jew hatred are once again proven to be a package deal. pic.twitter.com/YLYAB4A53SMany other X users posted similar tweets, mocking the political party for carrying the Italian flag instead of the Palestinian flag.Welfare Party of India in Kerala took out this rally in support of Palestine but with flag of Italy.

This is because they were carrying neither the Italian flag nor the Palestinian flag, they were carrying the flag of their own party.The flag of the Welfare Party of India has remarkable similarity with the Italian flag, as both the flags are made of vertical panels of green, white and red. However, there is a difference.In the Italian flag, all three panels are blank, but in the WPI flag, there are design elements in the white part in the middle. It has the olive leaves symbol in yellow and the words ‘Welfare Party’ written vertically in black inside the white panel.As the videos shared by the social media users are of low resolution, the yellow leaves symbol is mostly not visible against the white background. But parts of the words ‘Welfare Party’ in black are visible in some of the flags if the videos are observed carefully.Moreover, in other images and videos of the protest posted by the party and others, it is clearly seen that it is the party flag, not the Italian flag.In the video posted in the tweet below, which has better resolution, the yellow leaves symbol and black letters saying ‘Welfare Party’ are clearly seen in the flags carried in a pro-Palestine march by the party in Kozhikode.#Gaza_Genocide#IndiaWithPalestine: Massive rally in Kozhikode, Kerala – India by welfare party of India Kerala against #Israel's atrocities in #Palestine!Hundreds join in solidarity with #Gaza, chanting slogans like '#FreePalestine' and 'Stop #Gaza_Genocide'! pic.twitter.com/qE3ElKVkacTherefore, while the Welfare Party’s support for Palestinians is questionable given the horrific terror attack on Israel, the party didn’t make any mistake in picking the flag for the protest.

Are all of them with permission? No, but in this case, we have been seeking permission for the last four months. Why it was not given? And what is the necessity for the police to go there in mass and take that (flag pole) out in the wee hours? What is the need?

But when officials and workers arrived at the spot to remove the flag pole, around 110 BJP workers staged a protest against it. A police official said, “Despite repeated requests, they kept arguing with government officials. Subsequently, some of them were arrested and let off on bail.”The Tambram Police said that no permission was taken from the Greater Chennai Corporation before the installation of a 45-ft flag pole outside the compound wall of Annamalai’s house on Friday evening.According to the police, the flag pole was dangerously close to high-voltage power lines and was causing inconvenience to the public. They added that the corporation and the police later took the decision to remove the flagpole.As per the police officials, apart from Reddy’s arrest, they have also registered a police case against six persons.

62,"21 October, 2023 ","Gujarat: Pakistan-origin man arrested for spying in India 17 years after getting citizenship, allegedly sent malware to defence personnel","According to the ATS, Maheshwari helped Pakistani agents access an Indian SIM card, which they used to hack the phones of Indian defence personnel’s wards in Army schools.On 20th October (Friday), the Gujarat anti-terror squad (ATS) arrested a 53-year-old man named Labhshankar Duryodhan Maheshwari on charges of helping Pakistani agents to get sensitive information about Indian soldiers. Originally from Pakistan, Maheshwari was allegedly spying for Islamabad. According to the police officials, he was infecting the phones of Indian defence personnel with malware forwarded on WhatsApp.As per the officials, Maheshwari was a Pakistani native and in 1999 he came to Gujarat’s Tarapur town in Anand district. He arrived in Gujarat with his wife for “fertility treatment”. However, he stayed in India and established himself as a successful businessman. Later in 2005, he was granted Indian citizenship. However, his extended family still remained in Pakistan. ATS superintendent of police Om Prakash Jat said, “Labhshankar Maheshwari, who was living in Tarapur town of Anand district, has been arrested on accusations that he circulated malware through WhatsApp among defence personnel, which was used by Pakistani intelligence agencies to get information from their phones.” #WATCH | Ahmedabad, Gujarat: On the arrest of a Pakistani spy, Gujarat ATS SP Om Prakash Jat says, ""Gujarat ATS received input from the military intelligence that a Pakistani army or a Pakistan agent is using WhatsApp on an Indian SIM Card… He was sending Remote Access Trojan… https://t.co/JvitqnyjS7 pic.twitter.com/p3a362ZreUThe ATS SP Jat added that Maheshwari has been booked under Indian Penal Code (IPC) section 123 (concealing with intent to facilitate a design to wage war against the government) and 121-A (conspiracy to wage war against the government) and under relevant sections of the Information Technology (IT) Act. According to the ATS officials, the investigation revealed that Maheshwari agreed to participate in this conspiracy because he wanted to expedite the visa process for himself, his wife, and two other family members who wished to visit Pakistan to meet their relatives. Sharing the details of the case, Jat added, “The Indian Military Intelligence recently learnt that either the Pakistan Army or Pakistan’s intelligence agency had somehow acquired an Indian SIM card, which was being used for spying on Indian defence personnel by sending them malware through WhatsApp. Based on the information, we apprehended Maheshwari from Tarapur in Anand, where he runs a grocery shop.” According to the ATS, Maheshwari helped Pakistani agents access an Indian SIM card, which they used to hack the phones of Indian defence personnel’s wards in Army schools. As per the ATS investigation, the SIM Card was issued under the name Muhammad Saklain Thaim from Jamnagar. It was then activated on the mobile belonging to Azgar Hajibhai. After activation, the SIM card was delivered in Anand, Tarapur to a person named Labhshankar Maheshwari on the instructions of a person associated with the Pakistan Embassy. As instructed, Maheshwari, posing as an employee of an Army school, started sending messages to defence personnel. He used to urge them to download an ‘apk’ file and upload information about their children on the official website of the school, the ATS official added.Jat added, “In reality, that ‘apk’ file was a Remote Access Trojan, a type of malware that extracts all the information from a mobile phone, such as contacts, location and videos, and sends the data to a command and control centre outside India. As of now, we found that the mobile phone of a soldier stationed at Kargil was compromised with that malware. We are yet to ascertain how many more persons were targeted.” As per sources privy to the matter, in 2022, Maheshwari visited his parents in Pakistan. It is believed that the Pakistani agents “cultivated” him during the processing of his Pakistani visa. During his six-week stay with his parents, he is believed to have been in touch with a Pakistani intelligence agency, sources asserted.The investigation findings revealed that at one point, Maheshwari posed as an employee of an army school. He then persuaded parents to download a file claiming that it was necessary to record some information. In another instance, he falsely claimed that the apk file was linked to the government’s ‘Har Ghar Tiranga’ campaign. On the basis of the false claim, he convinced many army personnel to install the application. Apart from encouraging recipients to install the app, he used to ask them to upload a photo of their child with the national flag, however, it is alleged that the trojan malware was helping gather sensitive information.  While further investigation is ongoing, the officials added that other accused in the case are now on the run and are believed to have left the country.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

63,"21 October, 2023 ",Pakistan: Close associate of JeM chief Mohammad Masood Azhar and Lashkar-e-Jabbar founder Dawood Malik killed by unidentified men,"Dawood Malik was reportedly ambushed by anonymous assailants at a private clinic who opened fire at him before abscondingOne more terrorist involved in anti-India activities has been assassinated by unidentified gunmen on foreign soil. A major development transpired when Dawood Malik was shot dead in North Waziristan, Pakistan in the wee hours of 20th October. He was the founder of Lashkar-e-Jabbar and a close acquaintance of Jaish-e-Mohammed’s (JeM) Mohammad Masood Azhar, who is one of India’s most wanted Islamic terrorists.According to reports, the tribal leader was killed by masked gunmen in the Mirali area of North Waziristan. He was reportedly ambushed by anonymous assailants at a private clinic who opened fire at him before absconding from there. The occurrence has raised doubts about the possibility of a conflict between the terrorist groups active in Pakistan.The security agents had been closely monitoring him because of his crucial involvement in Lashkar-e-Jabbar, a radical group that is notorious for endorsing extreme views. His removal dealt a serious blow to the larger network of extremists he was affiliated with as well as to his own outfit. The number of anti-India terrorist killings in Pakistan and other nations is climbing.This most recent instance signifies an important setback in the group’s operations and adds to the already daunting problems they encounter. The incident which happened in broad daylight is the latest in a string of premeditated executions in the country targeted at terrorists who indulge in anti-India operations regularly. This incident came after Mufti Qaiser Farooq, a close friend of Lashkar-e-Taiba’s (LeT) Hafiz Muhammad Saeed was recently murdered in the centre of Karachi. A Dera Ismail Khan native, he had a close relationship with the internationally designated JeM terrorist and his death dealt a serious blow to the terror outfit. He was walking with a group of his madrasa students when he was ambushed mercilessly. The event was captured on CCTV footage that is in the custody of Pakistani security forces. Two people riding motorcycles swiftly opened fire and ended his life in an instant.The death of Mufti Qaiser Farooq is the sixteenth anti-India terrorist to be eliminated in the Pakistan-Canada region in the last nineteen months by attackers who remain unidentified. The episode was eerily similar to the killing of Maulana Ziaur Rahman, a prominent LeT terrorist which unfolded on 12 September in Karachi.The death of JeM member Mistri Zahoor Ibrahim also known as Zahid Akhoond who was a hijacker of the IC-814 flight marked the start of a ruthless series of planned murders of anti-India terrorists and activists abroad. He was shot twice in the head at close range by unidentified perpetrators. Pakistan’s Inter-Service Intelligence (ISI) and law enforcement officials are deeply perturbed by these bold executions.On 18 June pro-Khalisatn terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar was killed by two assailants within the premises of Guru Nanak Gurdwara Sahib in Canada’s Surrey four days after another Khalsitani terrorist and supremo of banned Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF) died in a London hospital.The terrorist Ripudaman Singh Malik a Khalistani was subsequently killed on 15 July 2022 in Surrey. He was the target of a premeditated operation. He was connected to multiple terror assaults including the bombing of Air India flight Kanishka on 23 April 1985, which claimed the lives of 329 innocent persons.These intentional murders have sent a warning that has rippled through Pakistan’s military corridors and forced the ISI to promptly relocate twelve of its most important ‘assets’ to safe havens. The deaths of two more LeT members, Abu Qasim Kashmiri in Rawalkot and Qari Khurram Shehzad in Nazimabad earlier this year made the implementation of this preventive measure necessary.A Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Bashir Ahmad Peer alias Imtiaz Alam was killed in an aggressive attack which took place inside the perimeter of ISI Headquarters and the military garrison town. The situation left the agency and Pakistan’s law enforcement authorities in a state of turmoil.Even in their zealous search for solutions, Pakistan’s security forces have been quick to blame India’s external intelligence agency and brushed aside information that indicated that local individuals were involved. The assailants were familiar with the neighbourhoods around their victims and they orchestrated their attack with unnerving accuracy. Complicity also made it easier for them to flee and blend in with the local population.Prime Minister Justin Trudeu’s Canadian government also accused India of the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar on the basis of ‘credible allegations’ which led to a major diplomatic row between the two countries and their relations continued to deteriorate.The reality of these occurrences highlights the complex network of terror and treachery that still permeates the region. These attackers who were familiar with the surroundings of their victims plotted their schemes with alarming accuracy with the help of accomplices who enabled them to escape easily.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

64,"21 October, 2023 ","‘Hamas is not a terror outfit, they are fighting for Muslims’: SP leader Sumaiya Rana justifies Hamas terror attacks against Israel","While speaking to News18, Rana claimed that Hamas is not a terrorist group, rather they are fighting to protect Al-Aqsa Mosque. She asserted that there is a conspiracy against Muslims and Islam in calling Hamas a terror organisation.On Friday (20th October), the national spokesperson of Samajwadi Party and poet Munawar Rana’s daughter Sumaiya Rana justified Palestinian terrorist group Hamas’s attacks on Israel which resulted in the death of over 1300 civilians. While speaking to News18, Rana claimed that Hamas is not a terrorist group, rather they are fighting to protect Al-Aqsa Mosque. She asserted that there is a conspiracy against Muslims and Islam in calling Hamas a terror organisation.“Everyone can see Hamas’s attack on Israel but no one is noticing the internal damage inflicted on Palestine,” Sumaiya Rana said while justifying Hamas’s onslaught. She added that lakhs of Palestinians have been killed over the last ten years by Israel.#HamasTerrorists did nothing wrong by kiIIing innocent Israelis, they should have done more damage – SP leader Sumaiya Rana (daughter of IsIamist Shayar Munnavar Rana)This is how IsIamists across the world think… They don't even shy away from defending terrorism. pic.twitter.com/SX3yRpgLNPShe further expressed her apprehension that the Israel-Hamas war may transition into a third-world war since several countries are getting involved in it.When asked about Hamas’s decision to attack innocent Israeli civilians, Sumaiya Rana asserted that Hamas’s attacks on Israeli people are due to the ongoing conflict pertaining to the land as well as ‘atrocities’ on Palestinians over the last decade. The Samajwadi Party leader went on to say that Hamas’s ‘reaction’ “is still not up to the level” and that Hamas will not back off.“They [Hamas terrorists] have understood that they have been given this life only to defend Al-Aqsa mosque and that is why they have dedicated their lives for this only,” Rana said.She further demonised the Israeli people labelling them as the most “cruel” community. The Hamas sympathiser went on to claim that Palestine is paying the price of giving refuge to the Jews. Sumaiya Rana added that the animosity between Jews and Muslims has been ongoing since the times of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.“They [Israelis] are inflicting atrocities on the followers of Islam and this conflict will never be resolved with dialogue. It will be resolved only when one of the sides dominates the other,” Rana asserted.She further pushed Hamas’s narrative that Israel had attacked the Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza which allegedly killed over 500 people. This comes even as multiple evidence suggest that Israel was not behind the attack.Despite being repeatedly questioned about Hamas’s killing of innocent Israelis in a brutal attack launched on 7th October, Rana downplayed Hamas’s offensive claiming that Israel has already been attacking Palestine.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

65,"21 October, 2023 ",“He has maintained high journalistic standards”: NYT defends rehiring Hitler-praising and pro-Hamas ‘journalist’ from Gaza for Israel-Hamas war,"As the war plays out in Gaza with Israel preparing for a ground invasion to flush out Hamas terrorists, the New York Times hired a known Hitler-praising and pro-Hamas journalist, Soliman Hijjy, to cover the unfolding conflict. On 20th October, Israel’s Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan lambasted The New York Times for rehiring a reporter from Gaza, Soliman Hijjy. Hijjy has a notorious track record of praising Hitler and taking a pro-Hamas stand. As per his author profile, he has resumed contributing to the New York Times after a gap of two years to ‘cover’ the Israel-Hamas war.  Responding to the criticism, NYT issued a statement defending its decision to rehire Soliman Hijjy. It claimed that after a review of his “problematic” social media posts which came to light in 2022, they took various actions following which Hijjy adhered to their standards of journalism. In its statement, the New York Times said, “We reviewed problematic social media posts by Mr Hijjy when they first came to light in 2022 and took a variety of actions to ensure he understood our concerns and could adhere to our standards if he wished to do freelance work for us in the future.” It further claimed that he maintains ‘high standards of journalism’ and has delivered impartial work for them even by putting his own life at risk in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. The statement added, “Mr. Hijjy followed those steps and has maintained high journalistic standards. He has delivered important and impartial work at great personal risk in Gaza during this conflict.” Earlier, the Israeli Envoy Erdan slammed NYT for rehiring a Nazi. He highlighted that as soon as Soliman Hijjy started contributing to the news portal, NYT immediately ran Hamas propaganda. He asserted that it carried out Hamas propaganda regarding the attack on Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza and falsely accused Israel of the attack. He also noted that Hijjy had a contribution in NYT’s reportage on the Hospital attack which later turned out to be false. However, despite facts coming to the fore on the al-Alhi hospital attack, NYT has not retracted its fabricated report, Erdan noted. It is important to note that on 17th October, a rocket attack took place on Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza after a Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket misfired and hit the parking space of the Hospital killing several civilians.Initially, NYT promoted Hamas propaganda without verifying the details. Titled “Israeli Strike Kills Hundreds in Hospital, Palestinian Officials Say,” the article laid the blame for the hospital attack on Israel. Later, when the lies were busted, it changed the title to “Hundreds Dead in Blast at Gaza Hospital, Palestinians Say.”Regarding NYT’s decision to rehire Hijjy, the Israeli Envoy tweeted, “The New York Times has just rehired a NAZI. Let that sink in. Soliman Hijjy praises Hitler, and the NYT rehired him. We all saw how the NYT immediately parroted Hamas’ lies regarding the al-Ahli hospital (which Hijjy contributed to) and still refuses to retract these fabrications. Spreading Hamas propaganda and rehiring a Holocaust-praising terror supporter, actively stokes anti-Semitism.”The @nytimes has just rehired a NAZILet that sink in.Soliman Hijjy praises Hitler, and the NYT rehired him.We all saw how the NYT immediately parroted Hamas’ lies regarding the al-Ahli hospital (which Hijjy contributed to) and still refuses to retract these fabrications.… pic.twitter.com/7WaCDm2YdXTargeting the NYT for being a mouthpiece of the Palestinian terror outfit, the Israeli Ambassador urged every Jew to stop reading or giving advertisements to the mouthpieces of Hamas. He added, “Every Jew must understand that not reading or advertising in Hamas mouthpieces is an integral part of our right to self-defence. And we must defend ourselves!!!” As per Hijjy’s byline (archived) on the news website, he began contributing ‘greatly’ to the NYT on 12th October this year after a long hiatus of two years. Interestingly, the majority of his work with the Times has been centred around the Al-Ahli hospital attack which was exploited by Hamas to falsely blame Israel for the attack. Prior to giving ‘contribution’ to the hospital attack in Gaza, Hijjy had last reported for NYT way back in July 2021, as per his byline on the news portal. In August 2022, HonestReporting, a pro-Israel media watchdog, revealed the controversial past of Hijjy whose work had been featured by the New York Times between 2018 and 2021.  HonestReporting highlighted that in 2012, Hijjy shared a Facebook post praising Adolf Hitler. In his 2012 FB post, Hijjy wrote, “How great you are, Hitler” in Arabic. In the post, he also attached a photoshopped image of Hitler seemingly taking a selfie. The Israeli outlet also highlighted that the Palestinian filmmaker Soliman Hijjy hailed the Nazi leader as recently as 2018. In a 2018 post, he shared a photo of himself with a caption that translated to either “I’m in tune like Hitler during the holocaust” or “in a state of harmony as Hitler was during the Holocaust”, as reported by Fox News. In a separate post, Hijjy referred to the terrorist group Hamas’ rocket fire toward Israel as “the resistance.”In 2018, the same year when he had praised Hitler and the Holocaust, Hijjy was hired by the Times as a freelance journalist. Afterwards, he worked on a slew of “visual investigations” published by the organisation through 2021. However, after his anti-Semitic posts praising Hitler came to the fore, his work didn’t appear in the Times anymore. Meanwhile, he also took down his controversial pro-Hitler posts. But he was recently rehired by the Times following the 7th October terrorist attack on Israel and his first work appeared around the same time when reports of purported attacks on Hospitals started coming to the fore from Gaza. Out of which, it was later revealed that the Al-Ahli attack occurred because a PIJ’s rocket misfired and hit the parking area of the hospital.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

66,"21 October, 2023 ","Mahua Moitra goes on a rant on X, says PAs and interns of all MPs use their parliamentary IDs, accuses Adani of offering her deal to ‘shut up’","Hiranandani is a businessman and he is not one of the Personal Assistants (PAs), interns, researchers, and staff members employed by Mahua Moitra, therefore her defence that staff and interns of all MPs use the Parliamenrary IDs is not convincing As the noose around Mahua Moitra tightens over the cash-for-questions scam, the TMC MP Moitra went on a rant from her X handle on Saturday (21st October). In a series of posts, she expressed her frustration over the current allegations against her and made various claims in this regard. However, she didn’t deny taking luxury gifts in exchange for asking questions in Lok Sabha, and also didn’t deny that billionaire businessman Darshan Hiranandani was using her Parliamentary portal account to post questions targeting Adani directly. Instead, Mahua Moitra claimed that every parliamentarian shares login IDs and passwords with staff, interns and others, asking the National Informatics Centre to disclose the details of the places from where the IDs of all the Members of Parliament were accessed.Mahua Moitra wrote in her first post, “Request NIC to please release ALL details of MPs publicly to show they were physically present in place from where IDs were accessed by their PAs & researchers/interns/staff. Don’t use Fake Degree wala for leak, make this public NOW.”Request NIC to please release ALL details of MPs publicly to show they were physically present in place from where IDs were accessed by their PAs & researchers/interns/staff. Don’t use Fake Degree wala for leak, make this public NOW.It is notable that BJP MP Nishikant Dubey said in an X post that Mahua Moitra’s NIC ID was being accessed from Dubai. Notably, in an affidavit filed with the Parliamentary Ethics Committee, Hiranandani Group CEO Darshan Hiranandani acknowledged that the TMC MP provided him with her Parliamentary login credentials which he used to ask questions from the central government on her behalf. Darshan Hiranandani is based in Dubai, and his affidavit was also signed in Dubai and was notarised by the Consulate General of India in Dubai.Darshan Hiranandani purportedly operated Moitra’s Lok Sabha account from Dubai and he would input questions against Gautam Adani on behalf of the TMC MP. In exchange, Mahua Moitra received heavy favours from the builder in cash and kind.Now, Mahua Moitra has pointed out that Personal Assistants (PAs), interns, researchers, and staff members of all the MPs access the IDs of the MP. She is using it as a defence by claiming that sharing the ID Password with Darshan Hiranandani does not violate any norms. However, Hiranandani is a businessman and he is not one of the Personal Assistants (PAs), interns, researchers, and staff members employed by Mahua Moitra. Mahua Moitra has not yet denied that she shared the login credentials with the real estate tycoon. If he has accessed it, it is still a violation of the rules unless Darshan Hiranandani is one of the staff members of the TMC MP.Mahua Moitra brazenly asserted that sharing login credentials of an MP’s ID with a member who is not from her staff is not a threat to national security. To back her argument, she targeted Gautam Adani without any support for her claims against the businessman as usual. She then repeated lies and unverified allegations against Adani. She said Adani has bought Mumbai airport, which is incorrect as the business group has only won a tender to operate the airport.She posted on X, “Unknown FPIs own Adani shares whose origin SEBI cannot find & Adani gets MHA clearance to buy Mumbai airport. This is the real question of National security. Not email ID that every PA & every unchecked intern team of every MP has publicly & accesses at will.”Unknown FPIs own Adani shares whose origin SEBI cannot find & Adani gets MHA clearance to buy Mumbai airport. This is the real question of National security. Not email ID that every PA & every unchecked intern team of every MP has publicly & accesses at will.Mahua Moitra did not stop here. She also implied in her next post on X that she is getting an offer from Gautam Adani to settle the matter. She alleged that she is getting an offer to shut up for six months in return for “peace” and another one to attack him but not the Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Mahua Moitra wrote, “Sorry Mr. Adani. I am not taking your deal to shut up for six months in return for “peace”. And nor am I taking the second deal where I am allowed to attack you but not the PM. Adani used to CASH TO NOT QUESTION. Now he is forced to create a fake CASH FOR QUESTIONS.”Sorry Mr. Adani. I am not taking your deal to shut up for six months in return for “peace”. And nor am I taking the second deal where I am allowed to attack you but not the PM.Adani used to CASH TO NOT QUESTION. Now he is forced to create a fake CASH FOR QUESTIONS.She also said in another X post that she is getting threats of a CBI raid at her residence. She wrote, “Also got a message about impending CBI raid. I am busy with Durga Puja. I invite CBI to come home & count my pairs of shoes. But first please file FiR into ₹13,000 crore coal money Adani stole from Indians.”Also got message about impending CBI raid. I am busy with Durga Puja. I invite CBI to come home & count my pairs of shoes. But first please file FiR into ₹13,000 crore coal money Adani stole from Indians.On 15th October, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Lok Sabha (MP) Nishikant Dubey levelled serious allegations against Trinamool MP Mahua Moitra, saying she took cash and gifts from businessman Darshan Hiranandani to ask specific questions against Gauta Adani in the Parliament. MP Dubey has submitted a formal complaint to the Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla seeking an inquiry against Moitra and urged the Speaker for her immediate suspension.Nishikant Dupey’s allegations were based on information provided to him by advocate Jai Anant Dehadrai, former partner of Mohua Moitra, who has been described as a ‘jilted ex’ by the MP. After that, the statement by Dehadrai appeared in public, giving detailed accounts of the allegations against Moitra. He said that Mahua Moitra received expensive gifts and other benefits from business tycoon Darshan Hiranandani, in exchange for asking questions in parliament targeting Gautam Adani, Hiranandani’s business rival in several sectors.While the TMC MP had denied the charges, things exploded on 19 October, when Darshan Hiranandani himself filed an affidavit, confirming the allegations. He confirmed that he was given Mahua Moitra’s Parliament login and password to post questions. Hiranandani also confirmed that he had given luxury gifts to Moitra, paid for her holidays and travels, helped her in renovating her house etc.The real estate tycoon said that Mohua Moitra chose to target Gautam Adani to attack Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as there was nothing to target the PM directly. Adding to the allegations, Darshan Hiranandani alleged that Mahua Moitra was getting unverified information from several people to target Adani. He specifically mentioned three names, journalist Sucheta Dalal, and lawyer couple Shardul Shroff and Pallavi Shroff. Notably, Shardul Shroff was in a bitter fight with brother Cyril Shroff over the control of their law firm, before it was split between them. Cyril Shroff’s daughter is married to Gautam Adani’s son.

67,"21 October, 2023 ","Kerala: Garment company in Kannur says it will not take fresh orders for uniforms of Israel Police, repeats Hamas lies on Gaza hospital bombing","The Maryan Apparel Pvt Limited's Thomas Olickal stated the company has decided not to accept any fresh orders from the Israel police force until the conflict in Gaza is resolved, accusing Israel of bombing hospitals in GazaA Kerala-based clothing firm that provides the Israeli police with uniforms has announced it would not take orders from Israel until peace is restored. This decision of the apparel company came amid the ongoing Israeli military operations against Hamas in Gaza in retaliation to the horrific terror attack by Hamas on Israel on 7 October. The owner of the business has cited moral grounds for his decision, accusing Israel of atrocities on Palestinians in Gaza. This company is situated in Kannur district of Kerala.The Maryan Apparel Pvt Limited’s Thomas Olickal stated the company has decided not to accept any fresh orders from the Israel police force until the conflict in Gaza is resolved. The classy light blue uniform shirts for the Israel police force are produced by Maryan Apparel Pvt Limited in Kerala’s Kannur district.Thomas Olickal said, “We have been making uniforms for the Israeli police since 2015. The Hamas attack, killing civilians cannot be accepted. Similarly, the revenge by Israel also cannot be accepted. Denying food and water to over 25 lakh people, bombing hospitals, killing innocent women and children and all cannot be accepted at all. We want the war to end and the peace to prevail.”It is notable that now it has been proven that it was a failed rocket fired into Israel from Gaza that fell on a Gaza hospital, but the owner of the garment company is still blaming Israel for the same. Initially, Hamas had claimed that the hospital was hit by an Israeli air strike and over 500 people died. But later it was found that a rocket fired by Palestinian Islamic Jihad had failed and hit the parking lot of the hospital, and the actual number of casualties was much less.Thomas Olickal added, “We request everyone to stop the war. The Israel force will not be short of uniforms because of our decision. But this is a moral decision. The bombing of the hospitals cannot be accepted. We have decided not to take further orders temporarily.”He further stated that his company will respect current contracts by international agreements, but will not accept new orders until the conflict is over. He said, “In a year we make up to one lakh shirts for Israeli policemen. We also make shirts and jackets for the Israeli Jail Police. About 30,000 to 50,000 shirts and jackets are sent for the jail police in a year.” He also said that last week after the war broke out, the company was informed by Israel that an extra supply of uniforms would be needed.Maryan Apparel Pvt Limited, which was founded in 2006 in the Kerala state-run Kinfra Park here, specialises in the uniforms of army troops, police officials, security officers, and health care professionals from all over the world. It also provides school uniforms, supermarket employee outfits, physicians’ jackets, coveralls, business attire, and other items.On 7th October, Hamas terrorists entered Israel using motor gliders, boats, and trucks, targeting civilians and Israeli soldiers. Since then, Hamas has taken over 300 people hostage. In response, Israel has launched counterattacks on the Islamic terrorists, vowing to dismantle their infrastructure.Amidst the ongoing violence, reports of a devastating explosion at the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in the Gaza Strip emerged. Palestinians and several Arab countries, including Jordan, Turkey, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, were quick to point fingers at Israel, accusing them of deliberately targeting the medical facility. The Kerala-based company has also cited the attack on the hospital as the reason to break the clothing supply chain of Israeli forces. Media houses like Al Jazeera, the Iranian channel Press TV, and the likes of Alt News co-founder Mohammed Zubair ran propaganda being pushed by Hamas, claiming it was an Israeli rocket. Later, multiple proofs appeared making it clear that Israel did not attack the hospital. It was revealed that the rocket that fell on the hospital was not shot by Israel but by an Iran-backed terrorist organisation, Islamic Jihad, that operates from Gaza.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

68,"21 October, 2023 ","‘Art, music, culture rise above nationalities’: Bombay High Court rejects plea seeking ban on Pakistani artists in India","""Arts, music, sports, culture, dance and so on are the activities which rise above nationalities, cultures and nations and truly bring about peace, tranquillity, unity and harmony in nation and between nations”, the bench noted.On Tuesday (17th October) the Bombay High Court dismissed a petition seeking an absolute ban on Pakistani artists in India. The petition was filed by a person named Faaiz Anwar Qureshi, who claims to be a cine worker and artist.A division bench comprising Justice Sunil Shukre and Justice Firdosh Pooniwalla rejected the plea saying that the petition is a backward step in propagating cultural harmony and unity, adding that the plea holds no merit.The court observed that arts, music, culture sports etc are beyond nationalities and bring peace and unity between different countries.“The petition is a retrograde step in promoting cultural harmony, unity and peace, and has no merit in it. A person who is good at heart would welcome in his country any activity which promotes peace, harmony, and tranquility within the country and across the borders. Arts, music, sports, culture, dance and so on are the activities which rise above nationalities, cultures and nations and truly bring about peace, tranquility, unity and harmony in nation and between nations”, the bench noted.The petition filed by Qureshi sought that the Information and Broadcasting Ministry, the Ministry of External Affairs, and the Ministry of Home Affairs issue relevant notifications barring the issuing of visas to Pakistani artists.In his petition, the petitioner cited a resolution passed by the All-India Cine Workers Association (AICWA) following the Pulwama terror attack. He also mentioned similar resolutions passed by the Indian Motion Pictures Producers Association (IMPPA) and the Federation of Western Indian Cine Employees (FWICE), which prohibited Pakistani artists from working in the Indian film industry. The MNS Cinema Wing also warned producers not to hire Pakistani artists, according to the plea.The petitioner’s lawyer, Vibhav Krishna, said that permitting Pakistani artists to work in the Indian entertainment industry could lead to discrimination against Indian artists because the beneficial atmosphere given to Pakistani artists in India is not available to Indian artists in Pakistan. He stated that the prohibition is vital to prevent Pakistani artists from using financial opportunities in India, which may potentially deprive Indian artists of similar opportunities.The court, however, rejected the petitioner’s viewpoint, emphasising the importance of cultural unity and international peace. The court emphasised that patriotism should foster togetherness and cultural exchanges rather than encourage hatred.“One must understand that in order to be a patriot, one need not be inimical to those from abroad especially, from the neighbouring country. A true patriot is a person who is selfless, who is devoted to the cause of his country, which he cannot be unless he is a person who is good at heart”, the bench stated.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

69,"21 October, 2023 ",Hurried trial: Supreme Court sets aside death penalty awarded to a man for rape and murder of three-month-old infant girl,"The petition was filed against a Madhya Pradesh Court ruling from December 2018 that upheld the verdict and the death penalty.On 19 October, the Supreme Court set aside the conviction of 25-year-old Naveen Gadke, who was awarded the death penalty for the rape and murder of a three-month-old girl. The apex court remitted the matter for a “de novo (new) trial” and mentioned that he was not given a “proper opportunity” to present his case. The trial made waves at the time after it was completed in a record 23 days from the date of the crime.The accused, who is a homeless man, was the subject of an appeal being heard by a bench of Justices BR Gavai, PS Narasimha and Prashant Kumar Mishra. The petition was filed against a Madhya Pradesh Court ruling from December 2018 that upheld the verdict and the death penalty. A bench presided over by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi at the time approved his request for special leave in March 2019 and temporarily postponed the Indore court’s decision.“We are of the considered view that the trial court conducted the trial in a hurried manner without giving the accused a proper opportunity to defend himself. Therefore, the judgment of conviction and sentence passed by the trial court and affirmed by the high court is hereby set aside and the matter is remitted to the trial court for de novo trial according to proper opportunity for the appellant to defend himself,” proclaimed the bench led by Justice Gavai after reserving the judgement. The court added, “The trial court and the District Legal Services Authority, Indore, are directed to provide assistance of a senior counsel to the appellant to contest the trial on his behalf.” Senior Advocate BH Marlapalle, who represented the plaintiff in the appeal, contended that the trial was rushed because of the intense media attention on the issue before both the top and the high court.“It was impossible for the accused himself to produce the authors of the DNA reports in one day because the experts are government servants and could not have attended the court at the request of an accused in jail. The trial court treated the accused as if he was carrying a magic wand which is available to produce highly qualified experts, who are government servants, on a phone call. There was no opportunity, in the real sense, for the appellant to cross-examine the experts.”The court then emphasised the value of a fair trial by citing other rulings. It further clarified the idea of ‘judicial calm’ in relation to fair trials and fervently defended adherence to the ideal in letter and spirit.The highest court added that because the offender’s two experts were government employees and could not have attended the court at his request, it was not possible for him to produce both of them during the trial, authors of reports like DNA and FSL, in a single day. “The trial court treated the accused as if he is carrying a magic wand which is available to produce highly qualified experts, who are government servants, on a phone call. There was no opportunity, in the real sense, for the appellant to cross-examine the experts”, the court noted.Following a 23-day trial in May 2018, a sessions court in Indore, Madhya Pradesh, sentenced Naveen Gadke to death for the rape and murder of a three-month-old girl. Naveen Gadke was given the death penalty after being deemed culpable for multiple violations under the Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO). Special Public Prosecutor Akram Sheikh pointed out the seriousness of the crime and pleaded with the court to consider it as one of the “rarest of the rare” cases.In April of that year, a 3-month-old infant, who was sleeping on the street beside her parents, was abducted from the area outside Indore’s famous Rajwada Fort. Her body was later discovered in an adjacent building’s basement, covered with blood. After the unfortunate event, a number of people were questioned on the same day and Naveen Gadke was taken into custody. The police completed their investigation in seven days and following a quick hearing, the trial court delivered its verdict on 12th May. The Madhya Pradesh High Court’s Indore bench subsequently upheld the lower court’s decision.“The rape of an infant is nothing but a monstrous burial of her dignity in the darkness. It is a crime against the holy body of a girl child and the soul of the society and such a crime is aggravated by the manner in which it has been committed. It was not committed by the accused under any mental stress or emotional disturbance and it is difficult to comprehend that he would not commit such acts and would be reformed and rehabilitated. The act of the appellant or accused meets the test of ‘rarest of the rare case’,” asserted the bench of Justice PK Jaiswal and Justice SK Awasthi and confirmed the death sentence.

70,"21 October, 2023 ",SFI goons assault and lock up a female ABVP worker in a Kerala college room for wearing a rakhi: Report,"K Aradhana, a female member of ABVP, was assaulted and locked up by SFI goons in the Kannur Government Polytechnic College for sporting a rakhi on her wrist. On October 16, K Aradhana, a female member of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), was locked up in a dimly lit room for several hours by Students’ Federation of India (SFI) goons at Government Polytechnic College in Kannur, Kerala, a report published in Organiser said. During this confinement, she was denied access to the restroom. The incident took place after she was assaulted by SFI members, an act prompted by her distribution of ABVP membership forms and wearing a rakhi on her wrist.She was forced into providing a written statement acknowledging her actions as wrong and committing to refrain from participating in ABVP activities on campus. ABVP has condemned this action by SFI as a violation of the girl’s rights. K Aradhana, a first-year student in the Textile Department, filed a complaint with the college principal regarding the ordeal she endured. In most cases, the principals running these colleges tend to lean towards the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM), and additionally, they harbour apprehensions about the militant tendencies associated with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM), Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI), and SFI.The SFI goons subjected her to verbal abuse and demanded that she remove the rakhi from her wrist, the report said. When she inquired about the reason for this demand, they argued that it shouldn’t be worn within the college premises. They proceeded to inspect her bag and subsequently locked her up in a room. Aradhana’s father had to visit the campus to secure her release from captivity. In the absence of the principal on the campus, law enforcement had to intervene to resolve the situation.ABVP has expressed its strong opposition to the acts of violence perpetrated by SFI. Gibin Raj, the president of ABVP in the Kannur district, stated that if the Principal supports those responsible for the incident, legal action will be pursued against him. He further emphasized that ABVP is committed to mobilizing students to counter acts of aggression and violence associated with the communist ideology.According to reports, the individuals involved in the attack have been identified as SFI members including Akash Babu, Anuprakash, Swaswat, Manas, Niranjan, Gopika, and Sukrita. The incident highlights a concerning trend where Marxist groups are influencing even young girls in a negative manner. The Kannur district has gained notoriety for instances of violence by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM) against their political opponents. Some of these incidents allegedly involve high-ranking CPM leaders, including Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan.Gibin remarked that democracy has long been silenced and buried within the confines of Kannur Government Polytechnic. They target workers from other organisations, obstructing their legitimate activities. These authoritarian tendencies are unfortunately seeping into other educational institutions as well. It’s worth noting that the CPM and their affiliated groups often vociferously advocate for women’s safety, yet they are involved in actions like assaulting a girl engaged in the activities of her own organization, which presents a stark contradiction.Strong aversion to customs rooted in Bharatiya and Hindu traditions, such as the rakhi festival, and assertive Hindus is not an uncommon occurrence in Southern India. Recently, several leaders, including DMK’s Udhayanidhi Stalin, A Raja, and Congress’ Priyank Kharge made disparaging remarks against Sanatana Dharma. In fact, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM) appears to oppose these values even more vehemently than religious extremists do. In response to the injustices suffered by Aradhana, members of ABVP organised a protest march. According to reports, the police have initiated legal action against certain SFI workers, as the college principal has not taken any measures to address the situation.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

71,"21 October, 2023 ","Palestinian Authority issues document containing Islamic verse calling to “murder Jews”, tells mosque clerics to incite violence","The PA document asserts that Palestine cannot raise the white flag until Israel is defeated and a Palestinian state is established. It also talks about making Jerusalem the capital of the Palestinian state after ""defeating"" Israel.Days after condemning Hamas’s terrorist attacks on Israel and then backtracking, the Palestinian National Authority or simply Palestinian Authority (PA) has now reportedly issued a call to “murder Jews”.A one-page document dated 18 October 2023 was issued by the Palestinian Authority’s Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs. The document issued to imams of mosques lays down directives for Friday (Jummah) sermons. This document contains a verse that calls for the murder of all Jews by Muslims.The document termed the attack on Gaza’s Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital that allegedly killed over 500 people as a “crime of the era” and blamed Israel for the attack despite the fact that it has been established that it was a failed Hamas rocket that hit the hospital.The PA document asserts that Palestine cannot raise the white flag until Israel is defeated and a Palestinian state is established. It also mentions making Jerusalem the capital of the Palestinian state after “defeating” Israel.This post from @Regavim_IL: The Palestinian Authority declares war – it must be stopped! An official document of the Palestinian Authority calls for incitement to murder Jews in the sermons that will take place in an hour (!!!) in mosques ""O Abd Allah, there is a Jew behind… pic.twitter.com/7aIMRZ9Rh6“The remains of children and the mothers of the dead and the wounded are a stain of shame on those who trumpeted the occupation… Our Palestinian people, despite the wounds and tragedies, cannot raise the white flag until the defeat of the occupation and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital,” the document in Arabic reads.The document inciting people to wage war against the Jews mentions Islamic verses, one of them from Sahih Al Bukhari (a collection of Hadith and book of Sunnah) which reads: “The hour will not come until the Muslims fight the Jews and the Muslims kill them, until the Jew hides behind the stones and trees and the stones or trees say, ‘O Muslim, O servant of Allah, this is a Jew behind me, come and kill him.'”The document was revealed by NGO Regavim movement, which said that this is proof that there is no difference between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority. The Regavim movement said, “This document is blatant and further proof that there is no fundamental difference between the goals of Hamas and the goals of the Palestinian Authority, which is also interested in one thing: the murder of Jews wherever they are, and the elimination of Jews from all over the country.”Interestingly, the President of the Palestinian National Authority Mahmoud Abbas had last week criticised Hamas for its terror attack on Israel which killed over 1300 Israeli civilians. However, PA’s official news agency WAFA (Wikalat al-Anba al-Filastinija) removed all references to his remarks about the Islamist terror outfit on 15th October.As reported earlier, during a telephonic conversation with his Venezuelan counterpart Nicolas Maduro, Abbas said that Hamas does not represent the Palestinians and that the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) is the sole representative of the Palestinian people.Moreover, Abbas condemned the killing of civilians on both sides and demanded the release of prisoners and detainees. Hours later, however, all the references to Hamas were removed without any explanation.Interestingly, the Palestinian National Authority first condemned Hamas, then quietly removed references to the terrorist group and is now calling Muslims to “murder Jews.”The Oslo Accords established the Palestinian Authority (PA) in July 1994 as an interim authority to rule sections of Gaza and the West Bank (excluding East Jerusalem) until an agreement on a solution to the Israel-Palestine issue could be reached.In September 1995, Oslo II interim agreement was signed which established the timeframe as well as methods for the futher processes of transfer of authority. Out of the six envisaged in the agreement, the Israeli defence forces had withdrawn from five prominent West Bank towns as the elections for chairman of the Palestinian Council and Palestinian Authority were to be held. The Israeli government, however, refused to withdraw its forces from Hebron in the wake of terrorist attacks and surging disdain for the Oslo II agreement among the Israeli people.Notably, the Palestinian Authority has not governed the Gaza Strip since Hamas took power in 2007, a year after emerging victorious in the 2006 elections for the Palestinian Legislative Council by securing 74 out of 132 seats. This added to the ongoing rivalry between Hamas and PA which was then controlled by Fatah (political party). In 2007, Hamas defeated Fatah after a violent conflict and seized control of the Gaza Strip.Notably, the PA President essentially serves as the Palestinian people’s spokesperson in the international community and in the negotiation bids with Israel.The president of the Palestinian Authority presides over the executive branch, which includes a council of ministers led by a prime minister. Along with the executive branch, the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) and the judiciary system are part of the PA.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

72,"21 October, 2023 ","Himachal Pradesh: Locals from tourism sector protest against the high tax on non-HP commercial vehicles, CM Sukhu agrees to lower it","Rahul Dhiman, the head of the Hotels and Restaurant Association of Dharamshala, explained that neither the government nor the Himachal Pradesh tourism sector would gain from the new chargeThe Himachal Pradesh tourism industry is still struggling to recover from the chaos caused by the floods during the monsoon, however, the sector has suffer another setback. The state government’s recent move to tax all commercial cars registered outside the state has agitated tour and travel agencies, per reports, as it will negatively impact the number of tourists.A notification was released by the state government in July which slapped a daily charge on vehicles entering Himachal Pradesh that ranged from Rs 3,000 to Rs 6,000. The tax went into effect on 1st September and is based on the number of seats in the automobiles. The head of the Himachal Pradesh Tourism Stakeholders Association, Mohinder Seth asserted that the state administration needs to remove the fee.After a meeting with a delegation of the Stakeholders Association in the state capital on 19th October, Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu assured that the new tax implemented on non-state commercial vehicles would be lowered. The CM said that a tourist helpline would be established shortly and linked to helpline number 1100. In order to boost tourism, the state government is going to introduce new home stay regulations and a new heliport in Shimla has also been recommended.Mohinder Seth, president of Himachal Tourism Stakeholders Association, released a statement and said, “We apprised the chief minister about the negative impact on the tourism industry due to new tax being levied on tempo travellers and tourist buses coming from other states. The CM agreed that tax was high and assured us that it would be reduced substantially.”The group had sent a letter to the Chief Minister on 18th October imploring that the state’s tourism industry would benefit from the new tax’s repeal. According to the letter, hotel occupancy has decreased since travel agencies are sending groups of visitors to other destinations, such as Uttarakhand and Kashmir, instead of Himachal Pradesh.Rahul Dhiman, the head of the Hotels and Restaurant Association of Dharamshala, explained that neither the government nor the Himachal Pradesh tourism sector would gain from the new charge. “The impact of the new tax is being felt in the tourism industry throughout the state. It will not only harm the industry but reduce the government earnings. It will be best for all if the decision is withdrawn by the government. Thankfully, Dharamshala hosted some of the World Cup matches that kept the hotel occupancy up, but we may also face hard times once the matches are over.”“Travel agents in places like Maharashtra and Ahmedabad are ditching Himachal for Uttarakhand and Kashmir. Why would they come to Himachal when they are being asked to pay through the nose,” he asked and remarked, “State government must understand that instead of earning additional money through new tax, it’s losing more.” Dhiman mentioned that from September to February, most tourists from West Bengal, Gujarat, and Maharashtra travel to Himachal in groups on buses and Tempo Travellers. He added, “Presently, hotel occupancy throughout the state is at its lowest. This just means that travel agents don’t want to suffer losses by sending tourist buses and Tempo Travelers to Himachal anymore.”In a letter, Rahul Dhiman also requested that the state government reverse its decision and highlighted the fact that no other place, including Uttarakhand and Kashmir imposes a levy of this kind. “The tourism industry of Himachal will never recover like this. First, it was Covid-19, then monsoon devastation caused huge losses. Now we have this.”Vinesh Shah, head of the Travel Agent Association of Pan India (TAAPA), said, “I would say around 5 lakh Gujarati tourists, who were scheduled to visit Himachal at this time of the year, are now going to Uttarakhand or Kashmir. The reason is simple. Why would we suffer losses by sending our vehicles to Himachal. The government is charging Rs 3,000 per day per Tempo Traveller from us. We have ended up paying more and earning less.”Shah announced that TAAPA would ask the Gujarat tourism ministry to arbitrate the conflict. “We are requesting Gujarat tourism ministry to speak to the Himachal government for resolving the issue. Of the total tourists that visit Himachal annually, 25% to 30% are from Gujarat. Just imagine the setback the tourism industry of Himachal will face if these charges continue. Himachal is trying to increase its tourist footfall but this surely is not the way to do it.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

73,"21 October, 2023 ",Sweden has a problem: ISIS returnees working with children and youth. Here is what a report says,"Over 40% of those who came back to the Nordic nation from the dreaded terror organisation have taken positions that involve children, youth and the vulnerable such as social workers, teachers, and childminders.According to a Swedish report, the country is under threat from the people who went to be part of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) or Islamic State and have assimilated with the society upon their return. More importantly, they are now working with the children which has posed a perilous situation in front of the authorities. The shocking revelation came to light when terrorist Abdesalem Lassoued who considered himself a soldier for the terrorist group left Brussels in quest of Swedes. He shot and killed two Swedish football fans on 16 October night and wounded a third. Following the heinous act of violence in Brussels, he proclaimed himself an Islamic State mujahedin (holy warrior). Now, he might disclose the whereabouts of the Swedish IS returnees.Over 40% of those who came back to the Nordic nation from the dreaded terror organisation have taken positions that involve children, youth and the vulnerable such as social workers, teachers, and childminders. “There are always jobs to be found in the preschool,” asserted the spouse of an IS terrorist who rose through the ranks before he died. She went on to work as a nanny upon her return.A mother of five, Camilla Olofsson left Sweden to join the terror outfit in Syria due to her allegiance to the same religion where she married off her two young daughters. However, two years later she moved back to Sweden and supported herself as a personal assistant. She was also enrolled in nursing school and worked for a private assistance firm when she was eventually caught and charged with crimes she carried out in the Middle East country.She is now serving a six-year and ten-month jail sentence for many counts of human trafficking as well as aiding and abetting severe rape, notwithstanding her denial. The victim was a young girl who was forced into marriage with an adult IS male and endured 100 counts of sexual assault. Notably, she isn’t the only one responsible for such gruesome actions. In accordance with the newspaper’s investigation, among 83 verified IS returnees, 21 of them found jobs assisting kids, young people and those who are disadvantaged which means more than one in four of them have careers in these professions. It further located 24 of them who have secured employment with governmental organisations. However, the Security Police have cautioned time and again about the prospect that those who have returned after fighting for IS could radicalise and recruit others in Sweden.Nanny and TeacherThese individuals are educators, nannies, social workers and youth leaders. After leaving life with IS and other radical Islamist groups, returnees have been assigned to roles where they are in charge of children and young people in a number of places. A youth from Gothenburg who travelled to IS territories in the fall of 2014 was hired by the municipality to oversee youngsters only a few months after coming back to Sweden.For many years, a middle-aged woman has been employed by her hometown municipality as a nanny and teacher. She and her daughter migrated to IS in Syria during the summer of 2015. She then promptly went back to work as a childcare provider after coming home and has several years of experience working in preschools and schools.A Stockholmer who journeyed to Syria in 2014 was explicitly invited to fight when he joined the terrorist group, per IS’s own recruitment documents. He is stated to have previously engaged in combat and been a member of the Islamist terrorist group Jaysh al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar in the same document.Later that year, he returned and based on his own resume he served as a housing supporter at a Homes for Care or Residence (HVB home) for unaccompanied refugee children in addition to getting hired by a home care company. He alleged, “This is something that I deeply regret.” He studied sociology and is currently employed in a Stockholm suburb as a social secretary.He argued he was only there for a few weeks and had to sign recruitment documents. He maintained that he did not want to discuss his experience in Syria. He once acknowledged that he went to the country, but he later retracted his statement. “I just want to focus on my life. It has gone well for me,” added before ending the call.Moreover, he could soon have a new colleague in the form of a woman who spent six years with IS in Syria. She was married to two Swedish IS terrorists and is now seeking a sociological degree, based on the media house’s probe. Afterwards, she procured a job in one of Stockholm’s neighbourhoods as a supervisor for youth who work during vacations.Social SecretaryA man from the Stockholm region who joined IS after going into their territory in April 2014 operated at a home care agency and an accommodation for unaccompanied refugees after returning home. Nowadays, he is a social worker.Care AssistanceA woman from West Sweden who ventured to Syria and lost her husband in warfare there held an occupation providing care assistance to the elderly before, during, and after the period she spent among the terror group.Substitute TeacherA 41-year-old Gothenburger visited Syria in August 2013 and attempted again in 2022 but was apprehended at Landvetter. Three months following his sentencing he taught as a stand-in after-school teacher. His resume informed that he has experience functioning for an aid company as a personal assistant.EducatorA 45-year-old resident of Gothenburg went down to Syria and intended to fight for IS in 2013 as well as in 2022 but he was captured at Landvetter. He worked as a student assistant and substitute teacher for a number of years prior to the arrest. He served a sentence and then pursued education to become a vocational guidance counsellor.Youth ManagerA man from West Sweden who travelled to Syria in October 2014 obtained a position as a youth supervisor in his native town shortly after coming home.Home ServiceA woman from West Sweden joined IS in the summer of 2015 and came back the following year. She has been employed by his hometown government providing in-home care for a while.AssistantA man from southern Sweden journeyed to Syria in February 2015 and was photographed while wielding an automatic weapon. He has since held a number of part-time positions, including one at his hometown municipality’s labour market administration.CoachAn inhabitant of southern Sweden enlisted in IS in Syria in the autumn of 2015. He began working as a coach at a municipal HVB home in February 2016 after returning where he was in charge of the boys and girls who were stranded refugees. Later on, he received compensation for working as a personal assistant.Those who enter conflict zones with the purpose of carrying out acts of terror are pursued by the security police. Security Police press secretary Fredrik Hultgren-Friberg believes that the IS returnees are not viewed as a cohesive group. According to him one of the police’s primary responsibilities when it comes to violent extremism is to essentially limit the space and slow down the movement’s long-term expansion through radicalisation, recruitment and propaganda.It is imperative that anyone who could constitute a security risk abstains from employment or participation in activities that could provide a platform for radicalisation or recruitment. “If it is the case that an individual based on a violent extremist ideology travels to a conflict area to, for example, fight for the caliphate or work for the caliphate, then, of course, it’s a criterion for the Security Police to follow up on that person.”According to the security forces, some of the individuals who went to Syria and the Islamic State may have strengthened their extremist theological and ideological roots there in addition to developing the potential to perpetrate crimes. They have also observed that some returnees rose to prominence in the violent Islamist milieus that exist domestically after their return.Undoubtedly, one of the criteria for the Security Police to look into someone is whether they travel to a conflict area based on a violent extremist ideology with the intention of fighting or working for the caliphate. Numerous returnees whom the newspaper has spoken with also talk about ongoing courtships and discussions with the Security Police.NannyA West Swedish woman who was employed by her hometown municipality for many years as a nanny migrated to IS in Syria during the summer of 2015. She went back to work as a childcare provider after her return and has several years of experience working in preschools and schools.KeeperA man from West Sweden who travelled to Syria in October 2014 was hired by his hometown administration to work as a caregiver for the impaired after some years.Preschool TeacherIn the summer of 2014, a woman from Central Sweden headed to be with her husband in IS and secured employment as a preschool teacher not long after returning.NannyA man who went to Syria in 2014 found work as a nanny not long after arriving back. He was employed in the healthcare industry for many years and reported to have been a rescue worker in an interview.School EmployeeA West Swedish woman who moved to Syria in September 2013 together with her combative spouse and their child returned the next year after which she spent two years working at a Gothenburg elementary school.Construction WorkerA West Swedish guy who went to Syria in 2013 summer came back to acquire a job as a construction worker at an administration in his hometown municipality.Student AssistantA Swedish woman who went to join IS in February of 2015 served as a nanny, a care assistant and now a student assistant since coming home. Another Stockholm-based woman who disappeared to Syria in the autumn of 2014. She gained employment as a student assistant at local schools after moving back home.Contact Person For ChildrenA man from West Sweden who flew to IS territory in 2013 worked as a child contact person in family care and a primary school soon after his return. Youth ManagerA lady from the Stockholm region went to Syria in May 2014 in the company of a renowned IS recruiter who was killed in action. Prior to her return to Sweden in 2021, she wed another IS terrorist and is now pursuing a degree in sociology and has worked monitoring adolescents.TeacherA Central Sweden man who vanished to become a member of IS in the autumn of 2013 was employed as a teacher, a position he still holds to this day, right after his return. He also worked for an organisation which offers homework assistance.Support AssistantA woman from West Sweden visited the IS region in 2014 and came back the following year. She was hired as a camp leader for kids and later as a staff member at a local drug rehab centre, soon after coming back. She is at present functioning as a disability support assistant.EconomistCentral Sweden man who went to Syria in 2013 autumn is currently employed as an economist to help with money-related subjects in his hometown municipality.Recreation EmployeeA female from the Stockholm region went to be a part of IS in December 2014. She spent a number of years working in an elementary school after-school program upon her return.One individual who worked in healthcare in one of the nation’s urban areas claimed that he was in communication with the Security Police as recently as a few weeks ago. He went to Syria in the beginning of 2014. He described himself as a paramedic and rescue worker and believed that his time in Syria was the reason behind the troubles in his personal and professional life that he encountered after coming home.His conviction is that, among other reasons, the managers did not renew his half-year temporary job as a nanny the year following his return to Sweden because they knew about his past. He complained, “My rights are extremely limited. And when you question why, the answer is always that you are under investigation. The problem is that the investigation will never end. To me, it feels like they want you to crack one day and for something to happen.”Two Terror Accused BrothersThe media house was able to report earlier this year on how an IS recruit who had been found guilty of terror was hired as a temporary leisure teacher in Gothenburg in the fall of 2022, three months after serving an eight-month prison sentence for breaking the travel law. In February 2022, he and his elder brother were taken into custody at Landvetter Airport. The Security Police unveiled that they were en route to Syria or Iraq with the intention of joining IS.A student assistant and a substitute teacher both of whom were deemed guilty of terrorism also took a picture at Landvetter Airport with the conviction of travelling to the terror outfit.He was still listed as an active substitute teaching instructor at the time of the disclosure in September of this year, however, was sacked after the alarming development. The head of the Gothenburg personnel section, Larisa Muslijovic, remarked at the time, “We can’t do these background checks. we don’t Google people.” The Security Police already knew of both brothers and based on intelligence reports, the pair were expected to have received religious and military training in Syria as early as 2013.When the brothers returned home that time, the younger worked as a personal assistant for a number of years while the older brother, who the Security Police maintained had fought in Syria worked for a number of years at a primary school in an unstable region of Gothenburg as a substitute teacher and student assistant.It was not until several months after the arrest at Landvetter when the elder brother was held on suspicion of terrorism-related offences which led to the termination of his professional duty. In response to the newspaper’s article earlier this year, the terror-convicted younger brother alleged, “I think that you can be as suitable or unsuitable as you want, both convicted and not convicted,” and underlined the significance of giving everyone a second chance.Mirsad BektasevicWhen Mirsad Bektasevic was just 19 years old, he was adjudged responsible for planning to commit terrorist acts. He proceeded to Syria to fight for a violent Islamist group after completing his term in 2014. After returning, he worked as a “miscellaneous worker” for a year. He is another prominent Syrian returnee who was charged with terrorism. The next year, once he came back he was hired as a “miscellaneous worker” for a brief period of time by Kungalv, his hometown municipality. However, his stay in Sweden was brief. He was nabbed in January 2016 once again. At the time, he was in Greece en route to Syria once more when he was proven culpable of being a member of a terrorist organisation and sentenced to prison, even though he denied it. The media house conducted an inquiry on him who previously acknowledged going to Syria and acting as the “police chief” in charge of setting up roadblocks outside of Aleppo, among additional duties.Many of the people the newspaper had a conversation with also took extreme measures to disassociate themselves from the events in Syria. They contended that it was cult-like conduct, they were naive and “brainwashed” at the time. “People can get indoctrinated and join cults of many kinds and mistakes can happen in life. If you decide to quit, you need to still be allowed to have the opportunity to live a regular life and be given another chance,” voiced the widow of a high-ranking IS fighter.She alleged, “Right now, I’m as far away from that life as it gets. I live a very different life.” She returned to Sweden and went on to work as a preschool teacher. When her spouse was neutralised, the Pentagon classified him as a trusted cadre serving in a foreign IS fighter brigade.Aman who now has his own logistics company and was hired by the municipality soon after returning home would prefer to forget his time spent in Syria. Along with a man who is currently believed to be imprisoned by Kurdish forces, he went to Syria and underwent combat training before deciding to come back after a brief stay with IS.He is of the opinion that it is vital to be able to live a normal life at some point, but he also believes that it is not unreasonable for individuals who, like him, sympathised with and supported a movement like IS to face consequences. “I can’t just sit here and moan about what this has done to me. However, I hope I have now paid my dues to society.”He boasted of comprehending Sapo’s (Swedish Security Service) actions as well. “If I was sitting at Sapo or wherever it may be, then they had a distrust of me, that goes without saying. I don’t see that as so freaking strange. That would be as naive as I was when I went down. Everything has a consequence. I’m just glad I didn’t do anything down there that I couldn’t live with today.”ConclusionJihad has posed an existential threat to the entire world. India has been its victim for decades and now the jihadi uprising in Europe as evident from recent violence in France and its other parts as well as massive rallies in support of Hamas amidst the Israel–Hamas conflict has further exposed the problem. Now, the startling discovery of terrorists amongst civilians particularly kids has only served as a reminder of the flaws of the West’s broken security system and its susceptibility to the murderous jihadist doctrine.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

He also noted that the entire government functionaries including the Prime Minister are present on the National Informatics Centre (NIC) portal which was allegedly being operated from Dubai at the behest of the TMC leader. On 21st October (Saturday), BJP Lok Sabha MP Nishikant Dubey launched a fresh offensive against TMC MP Mahua Moitra in connection with the ‘cash for query scam’ in which the latter is an accused. Taking to X, he alleged that the TMC leader mortgaged the national security for her monetary benefits. However, he didn’t explicitly name her in the post. As per Nishikant Dubey, the TMC leader’s parliamentary ID was used in Dubai when she was present in India. He also noted that the entire government functionaries including the Prime Minister are present on the National Informatics Centre (NIC) portal which was allegedly being operated from Dubai at the behest of the TMC leader. According to him, these revelations have been disclosed by the NIC and they have also shared the information with probe agencies.In his post on X written in Hindi, Dubey said, “An MP mortgaged the country’s security for some money. Parliament IDs were opened from Dubai, at that time the MP was in India. The entire Indian government, the Prime Minister of the country, the Finance Department, and the central agencies are on this NIC (portal).

Interestingly, while she argued that there was no way a wealthy businessman like Darshan Hiranandani who has access to PMO and ministers would be compelled by a first-time MP like her, she did not deny taking gifts from the businessman. Moreover, she did not refute the most controversial accusation pertaining to the alleged “cash-for-query” scam, which is sharing her parliament login credentials with Hiranandani to target Gautam Adani.In an attempt to divert attention from the serious allegations levelled against her, in her 2-page ‘statement’, she mentioned words like, “Samdhi” and “jilted-ex”.Earlier it was widely reported that the co-accused in the Mahuagate, Darshan Hiranandani confirmed the allegations that he colluded with TMC MP Moitra to target the Adani group. Turning an approver in the case, he added that Mahua Moitra gave him parliamentary login credentials and took luxury gifts for asking questions that were  targeted against Adani. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Action will be taken against unnecessarily stopping and searching people at night,"" Bhatinda Range ADGP Surinderpal Singh Parmar said.Common people and police have now come face to face in Bhatinda on the issue of drug smuggling in the district. Groups of local residents have been seen patrolling the area at night to stop the drug supply, however, police have said that it is against the law as it is their work to conduct investigation.In rural areas, along with men, women and children were also forced to patrol the streets late at night to catch drug smugglers. In Bathinda, women are keeping a night vigil.“Drug smuggling is taking place secretly. There is a lot of cheating going on. This is the work of the government, if they want, can shut down this smuggling in a minute but they are not doing so. Drug smugglers supply drugs at night. Police do not take any action, hence the villagers have started a campaign of blockade and patrolling at night,” a woman from the Bhatinda said.However, Bhatinda Range ADGP, Surinderpal Singh Parmar has said that nobody has the right to take the law in their hand. It is the Police’s duty to investigate anyone.“Nobody is allowed to take the law in their hands. If you are fond of stopping and searching people by creating blockades, then join the police. Action will be taken against unnecessarily stopping and searching people at night,” he said.He further said that people being searched unnecessarily, is wrong. “This is the job of the police, it is the job of the people to inform the police and not to take the law into their own hands.”However, the locals say this effort is needed to keep a check on rampant drug smuggling.“People from outside villages come here and smuggle drugs, which gives a bad name.

Alliance partner Congress, says party talking about caste census only for its own political benefit"," He highlighted that it was the same Congress party which didn’t disclose numbers of the caste census while it was in power at the Centre. A day after accusing his I.N.D.I. alliance partner Congress of ‘betrayal’, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav launched a fresh attack on the grand old party. Akhilesh Yadav took a dig at the his alliance partner for asking nation-wide caste census asserting that it was being done for political benefit. While participating in the Lok Jagran Abhiyan program in Hardoi, he asserted that it is a ‘miracle’ that Congress is ‘now’ asking for caste census. Former UP Chief Minister Akhilesh also emphasised that Congress has now realised that voters in backward communities don’t support their party. He highlighted that it was the same Congress party which didn’t disclose numbers of the caste census while it was in power at the Centre. He added that his I.N.D.I. alliance partner is now supporting the demand for caste census only because “they won’t succeed” without the support of backward castes.Akhilesh said, “…It’s the same Congress party that didn’t give the numbers of the caste census. It is a ‘miracle’ because now everyone knows that until and unless you don’t have the support of the backward castes you won’t succeed… It’s a miracle that now the Congress party wants a caste census. Congress party is now aware that the vote they were searching for is not with them anymore.”#WATCH | Hardoi: Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav says, ""…It's the same Congress party that didn't give the numbers of the caste census.

He added that if Congress continues to behave like this, nobody would be able to trust them. He added, “If Congress didn’t want to give seats (in MP), then they should have said it before. Today, SP is fighting only on seats where it has its own organisation. Now after Madhya Pradesh, I know that the I.N.D.I. alliance is for the (parliamentary) elections on a national level. If Congress continues to behave like this, then who will trust them? If we fight with confusion in mind against the BJP, then we won’t succeed.”The discord between I.N.D.I. alliance partners Congress and SP came to the fore when Congress party ignored Samajwadi Party and Akhilesh Yadav ahead of the assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh.Assembly election in Madhya Pradesh is scheduled to take place next month. Let alone giving the six seats that were promised, Congress did not allocate even a single seat to the Samajwadi Party that has left Akhilesh belittled and furious.Following the development, the Samajwadi Party supremo declared that he would not have attended any meetings if he had known that there was no state-level alliance. Meanwhile, SP also fielded its candidates on 31 assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh. The strife between both the parties escalated, particularly after Congress’ UP President Ajay Rai requested SP to withdraw from Madhya Pradesh as it “did not have a base” there.“The (Congress’) state chief has no authority. He was not there in the meetings held at Patna, Mumbai. What does he know about the INDIA alliance,” the SP supremo asked.Akhilesh Yadav further observed, “These people from Congress are involved with the BJP. If I had known that the alliance is not on the state level then I would not have sent SP leaders to Digvijaya Singh. I would not have trusted them if I had known that people from Congress would betray us. Congress should not get statements made by their small-time leaders about our party.”According to political experts, if the strife escalates further, SP could devise plan to play spoil sport for its I.N.D.I. alliance partner, Congress, in two key Lok Sabha seats, Rae Bareli and Amethi, jeopardising Congress’ prospects in these constituencies which were once considered its bastion. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

78,"21 October, 2023 ","Chhattisgarh: BJP worker shot dead in Naxal-affected region, party says killed for worshipping Durga","Sarju Tekam, a tribal leader, openly threatened to harm BJP leaders during a public speech in the presence of a Congress MLA. Unidentified assailants shot and killed a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) worker in the Maoist-affected town of Ambagarh Chowki, situated in the Mohla-Manpur district of Chhattisgarh on Friday.Police reported that Birju Taram, a resident of Sarkheda village, was fatally shot by a group of unidentified individuals while he was walking outside his home on Friday evening.Taram, the former Manpur division general secretary, currently held the position of deputy president in the BJP’s farmers unit. Ravindra Singh, the secretary of BJP’s Rajnandgaon district, mentioned, “Sarkheda is a village plagued by Naxal activity. Sarju Tekam, a tribal leader, openly threatened to harm BJP leaders during a public speech in the presence of a Congress MLA. Several months ago, unidentified individuals desecrated a Durga idol in Sarkheda. We suspect that our party worker Taram was murdered due to his association with the worship of the Durga idol.”Following the revelation of the murder, senior BJP leaders swiftly turned to social media. They drew parallels between Chhattisgarh and West Bengal, emphasizing the deteriorating law and order situation in the state and characterizing the murder as a deliberate and targeted killing.Raman Singh, the former three-time Chief Minister and a vice president of the BJP, expressed, “The law and order situation in Chhattisgarh has deteriorated to a level reminiscent of West Bengal. As the election process has commenced, BJP workers are facing significant pressure.”“Today, near Aundhi, our senior party worker, Birjhu Taram, who warmly welcomed me on stage and was part of our rally, was brutally murdered. His only ‘crime’ is being a BJP worker who supports the worship of the Durga idol. Some individuals had issued threats, and it appears that this incident is a result of those threats. The government has failed in providing security to BJP workers. I hold the government and local administration responsible for this incident because they failed to take action against the individual who made the threat. Timely action could have prevented this tragedy,” he said.Arun Sao, overseeing the BJP party in Chhattisgarh, stated, “Yet another BJP worker has been tragically lost. This is a deliberate act, similar to what occurred earlier this year. Their intent is to instill fear in the hearts of our workers, but we will not be intimidated. The sacrifices made will not be in vain. We are determined to triumph over the Congress party in the upcoming election and restore law and order in Chhattisgarh.” Earlier this year, four BJP leaders and functionaries fell victim to Maoist attacks.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

However, the Rafah crossing was opened without Hamas meeting the Israeli condition.Amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, the first convoy of trucks carrying relief materials entered the Gaza Strip from Egypt today. 20 trucks have entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing. The crossing was opened for the first after it was closed following the Hamas terror attack on Israel on 7 October.“The relief aid convoy that is supposed to enter today includes 20 trucks that carry medicine, medical supplies, and a limited amount of food supplies (canned goods),” a statement from Hamas’s media office said on Saturday.Over 200 trucks are waiting near the border for several days waiting to enter Gaza with around 3000 tons of food, water, medicine and other essential items. While aid agencies and other nations were urging Israel to let the aid material enter Gaza, Israel was insisting that Hamas must release the hostages first. However, the Rafah crossing was opened without Hamas meeting the Israeli condition.The terror group yesterday released two American women, Judith Raanan and her teenage daughter Natalie, but continues to keep over 200 people hostage, including children and elderly people.Our first humanitarian aid convoy from Egypt entered Gaza through the Rafah crossing 🇪🇬🇵🇸✌️❤️🙏 10:10 AM 21.Oct pic.twitter.com/U7FKcsgdniU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had said, “these trucks are not just trucks – they are a lifeline, they are the difference between life and death to many people in Gaza,” urging the border crossing to be opened for humanitarian aid. The crossing was opened after several rounds of negotiations with Israel. The Israeli govt has demanded a mechanism to inspect the aid, and a measure to ensure it does not reach Hamas terrorists.The aid that reached Gaza today is only a small faction of what is needed. Before the current conflict, around 450 trucks carrying aide materials used to enter Gaza daily from Egypt. U.N. officials say at least 100 trucks daily are needed to cover urgent needs and that any aid operation must be sustainable at scale. Most of Gaza’s 2.3 million people depend on aid send by international agencies and foreign countries, mostly the Middle Eastern nations.Rafah is the only border crossing with Gaza that does not border Israel. Earlier, the Kerem Shalom crossing with Israel was also used to deliver aids, but now Israel has said that it will not open the crossing until Hamas releases all the hostages it abducted during the 7 October attack.While trucks have started to move into Gaza, foreign nationals are expected to leave Gaza through the Rafah crossing soon. A large number of foreigners are waiting near the border to leave the territory as soon as possible. Earlier, the U embassy in Jerusalem had said that it had received information that the border crossing will be opened at 10 am.However, the embassy had warned about a “potentially chaotic and disorderly environment on both sides of the crossing,” asking people to assess the situation before heading towards the crossing. “If the border is opened, we do not know how long it will remain open for foreign citizens to depart Gaza,” the US Embassy had added.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

During his address to the students of Xinjiang University, he lectured about Gaza and the so-called atrocities against Palestinians. Pakistani Prime Minister also bragged it as if he was raising the voice of the voiceless, comfortably ignoring that Muslims in Xinjiang province are perpetually subjected to Chinese oppression.Anwaar ul Haq Kakar posted from his X handle, “While concluding my address to the students of Xinjiang University in Urumqi today, I raised my voice to speak for the voiceless people of Gaza under Israel’s ruthless aggression.”While concluding my address to the students of Xinjiang University in Urumqi today, I raised voice to speak for the voiceless people of Gaza under Israel's ruthless aggression pic.twitter.com/5x17z7YwBbIn his speech, Anwaar ul Haq Kakar said, “I am saddened in an environment where the situation in the Middle East, particularly with reference to Gaza has saddened a million and millions of peace-loving people across the globe coming from diversifying ethnic groups, religious groups. This act of barbarism has appalled everyone including Pakistani nation, Chinese nation, and other nations around the globe. We appeal and we will play our role to stop this barbaric act against the innocent Palestinian civilians.”It is notable that China has oppressed the Uyghur Muslims in the Xinjiang province for a long time. Muslims are kept in ‘re-education’ camps, where they are motivated to leave Islam. China has also banned the display of Islamic religious signs, demolished a large number of mosques, and changed the facade of others to make them not look like mosques. However, in order to portray that all is well for the Muslims in Xinjiang, Pakistan’s PM Anwaar ul Haq Kakar also visited a mosque in Xinjiang. He also posted a short video clip of the visit from his X handle. In the caption of the video, he wrote, “Had the opportunity to offer Friday prayers today at the historic mosque in Urumqi, Xinjiang Province, China.”آج جمعہ کی نماز چین کے صوبہ شنجیانگ کے شہر اُرمچی میں تاریخی مسجد میں ادا کرنے کا موقع ملا۔ pic.twitter.com/QryjZYnKAwThe flagrant display of hypocrisy by Prime Minister Anwaar ul Haq Kakar during his address at Xinjiang University is not only prominently noticed but also glaringly contradictory. While fervently advocating for the rights of Palestinians during his address in a province marred by Chinese oppression, he conveniently chose to turn a blind eye to the plight of the Uyghur Muslims, who face systematic discrimination and human rights violations under the same government that Pakistan is indebted to. This paradoxical stance echoes the insincerity of Pakistan’s moral compass, raising pertinent questions about the selective nature of its purported advocacy for oppressed communities. It is notable that Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, and other religious minorities in Pakistan itself face dire discrimination and violence on religious lines. With this move, Prime Minister Kakar has showcased not only the hollowness of his solidarity but also the inherent contradictions and sheer imprudence of his political rhetoric.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Benzema, who currently plays in the Saudi league, has issued a denial through his lawyer.While speaking to “conservative” news channel CNews on Monday (16th October), French Interior Minister Daramanin alleged that footballer Karim Benzema has “a notorious connection, as we all know, with the Muslim Brotherhood.”“We are fighting the hydra that is the Muslim Brotherhood because it creates an atmosphere of jihadism,” Daramanin added.On Thursday (19th October) Daramanin, in an interview with BFMTV, slammed the former French striker for not expressing sympathies for the 1400 Israelis killed by Hamas even though Benzema expressed solidarity with the Gaza residents. “Benzema still hasn’t made a tweet for the murder of this teacher in Arras … for the beheaded babies …. for the raped women, for the 1,300 massacred by Islamist terrorism in Israel,” Darmanin said.“If Mr. Benzema is able to show in front of 20 million people who follow him, including those who follow him because he now lives in Saudi Arabia and because he is eminently French, that he also mourns the death of this teacher, I will withdraw my comments,” Daramanin continued.Daramanin went on to say that Karim Benzema has made the” extremely selective choice” to use the same discourse as the Muslim Brotherhood.Meanwhile, Benzema’s lawyer Hugues Vigier has denied the allegations levelled against the footballer claiming that Benzema has never had any connection with the Muslim Brotherhood. He added that Benzema’s X post about the people of Gaza was just an expression of “natural compassion with what many today describe as war crimes being committed in Gaza, but which does not detract from the horror of the terrorist acts of October 7, something not open to discussion”. Vigier added that his team is considering to sue Minister Daramanin over his allegations against the footballer. Notably, after Daramanin’s comments regarding Karim Benzema’s alleged links with the terrorist group Muslim Brotherhood, French Senator Valerie Boyer, vice-president of the conservative Les Républicains Party, called to strip Benzema of his French citizenship and Ballan d’Or award.In a press conference on Wednesday (18th October), Boyer said, “If the remarks of the Minister of the Interior are proven, consider a symbolic sanction by withdrawing the Ballon d’Or” from Karim Benzema. We cannot accept that an internationally known French dual national could dishonour and even betray our country in this way.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

83,"21 October, 2023 ",ABES college website hacked after student was thrown off stage for chanting Jai Shree Ram: Jai Shree Ram message and teacher Mamata as Surpanakha,"The website seems to have been hacked after videos of a cultural fest at ABES College went viral on social media. On the 20th of October, a student from ABES College of Engineering in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, found themselves reprimanded by an assistant professor during a college cultural festival and student induction program.The official website of ABES College appeared to be hacked on the 21st of October. On the website, the message of Jai Shree Ram was displayed along with a morphed image of Professor Mamata Gautam, showing her as Surpanakha. On the hacked website, an image of Lord Ram was displayed along with an image of teacher Mamata Sharma as Surpanakha. Along with these images, a message was displayed on the website which read, “Jai Shree Ram. Only demons have a problem with the name of Lord Ram”. The website seems to have been hacked after videos of a cultural fest at ABES College went viral on social media. On the 20th of October, a student from ABES College of Engineering in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, found themselves reprimanded by an assistant professor during a college cultural festival and student induction program. The professor, identified as Mamata Gautam by social media users, scolded the student for greeting the audience with a courteous “Jai Shri Ram.”The incident came to the fore after the video of a professor yelling at the student went viral over the internet. The teacher scolded the student saying, “Why did you raise the slogan of Jai Shri Ram? Do you come to the college for this? This is a cultural program. This cannot be allowed. Out. Get Out.” Meanwhile, the student said that he was just responding to the ‘Jai Shri Ram’ calls from the audience.Per reports, when the student on the stage and the audience chanted Jai Shree Ram, he was stopped and reprimanded by Professor Shweta Sharma. Thereafter, Mamata Gautam also took to the stage to reprimand and humiliate the students for chanting Jai Shree Ram. Mamata Gautam has now issued a statement in her defence. Mamata Gautam said that she has no problem with the slogans of Jai Shri Ram and that she herself observes nine days fast during the Navratri festival. Gautam apparently made the video while sitting in a room with idols of Hindu gods behind her. The ABES Engineering College teacher claimed that the student who raised Jai Shri Ram slogan was arguing with her colleague and thus she stopped him from arguing. “There was nothing like this. Me, my colleagues and my college people have no problem with the Jai Shri Ram slogan. Neither we have, nor we ever will have an issue with the slogan. That student (Lakshay Sharma) was arguing with my colleague and I went there and told him that he said this (Jai Shri Ram). And as a discipline and cultural coordinator, I told him that you only said this,” Professor Gautam said. “I am a Sanatani Brahmin and I am from Brij and as you all know Shardiye Navratri is going on. During the Navratris, we observe fast for nine days and perform the Pooja-path. We don’t have any problem and will never have with slogans of Jai Shri Ram,” Gautam said.Update: After the news went viral, the website now seems to be restored to its original state. However, the college authorities are yet to issue any statement in this regard. The report will be updated in case they issue a statement.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

85,"21 October, 2023 ","Former England captain Michael Vaughan mocks Pakistan coach Mickey Arthur, says Rohit Sharma asked DJ to not play ‘Dil Dil Pakistan’ as part of a strategy","Vaughan was speaking during the 'Club Prairie Fire' podcast with Adam Gilchrist. The former Australian great couldn't stop laughing at this brutal dig at his compatriot and now Pakistan coach Mickey Arthur.In the 12th match of the ongoing Cricket World Cup 2023, India thrashed Pakistan comprehensively by 7 wickets with over 19 overs to spare. After being completely outplayed by India, Pakistan players and management were left with precious few excuses, and yet they managed to find one. Speaking after the game, Pakistan coach Mickey Arthur complained that he didn’t hear the DJ play ‘Dil Dil Pakistan’ too often during the match.With his bizarre remark, Mickey Arthur has become a subject of jokes from former cricketers and fans alike. Talking about Arthur’s bizarre excuse, former England captain Michael Vaughan said, “Without doubt, Rohit Sharma’s best move, and the move that won them the game, and the Pakistan coach alluded to it afterwards, is Rohit obviously said to the DJ- Just do not play ‘Dil Dil Pakistan’.This is brilliant by @MichaelVaughan .. ha ha. The whole hilarious statement by the Pakistan coach about not hearing ‘Dil Dil Pakistan’ In Ahmedabad.. and their loss to India .. must watch. #INDvPAK #CWC23 #CricketTwitter pic.twitter.com/mWSdtUKyILThe Ashes winning captain further added, “If they played ‘Dil Dil Pakistan’, Pakistan were going to win. Do not play that song pre-match. Make sure they don’t hear that inspirational song that obviously makes them play so well.”Praising Rohit Sharma for this “innovative” strategy while taking a dig at Arthur, vaughan said, “That was clever. Most captains don’t think of things like that. The DJs, the music. Rohit is ahead of his times.”Vaughan was speaking during the ‘Club Prairie Fire‘ podcast with Adam Gilchrist. The former Australian great couldn’t stop laughing at this brutal dig at his compatriot and now Pakistan coach Mickey Arthur.Vaughan is not the only ex-cricketer laughing at the strange excuse that was put forward by Mickey Arthur after the loss to India. During Pakistan’s loss to Australia, former Indian opener Akash Chopra also brought up the excuse and asked the DJ to play ‘Dil Dil Pakistan’ song when Pakistan was struggling to take a wicket during the Pakistan-Australia match.Koi DJ ko keh kar ‘Dil Dil Pakistan’ bajwa do at The Chinnaswamy. Pakistan desperately needs a wicket. It’s a flat track alright but this is fast moving towards 375+ score. #CWC23 #PakvAusAfter winning their first 2 matches, Pakistan have now lost back-to-back games and even their Net Run Rate has also been badly hit. Mickey Arthur will be hoping they can bounce back quickly and start winning again so that people forget his strange excuse.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

86,"21 October, 2023 ","Justin Trudeau ‘puts aside’ one lie to peddle another, now says India violated Vienna convention by asking diplomats to leave: How he is wrong, as usual","During a press conference in Brampton, Ontario, Justin Trudeau claimed that the Indian government's actions were creating an ""unbelievably difficult"" situation, disrupting the normal lives of millions in both India and Canada. This, of course, does not make sense, just as most of what Trudeau says.On Friday (20th October), amidst the escalating diplomatic tension between India and Canada, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau remarked that India’s move to revoke the diplomatic immunity of 41 Canadian diplomats constitutes a breach of the Vienna Convention. Justin Trudeau said that this is a matter that should concern all nations. Trudeau’s statement followed shortly after New Delhi dismissed Ottawa’s claim that the enforcement of parity amounted to a violation of global standards.During a press conference in Brampton, Ontario, Justin Trudeau claimed that the Indian government’s actions were creating an “unbelievably difficult” situation, disrupting the normal lives of millions in both India and Canada. This, of course, does not make sense, just as most of what Trudeau says. He, as usual, provided no evidence to substantiate his figments of imagination – about the contravention of the Vienna convention or how India is making life difficult for millions in India and Canada. Justin Trudeau said, “The actions that the government of India took this week are themselves contrary to international law. The government of India decided to unilaterally revoke the diplomatic immunity of 40 Canadian diplomats in India. This is a violation of the Vienna Convention governing diplomacy. This is, them choosing to contradict a fundamental principle of international law and diplomacy.” It is worth noting that he did not provide the section of the bylaw of the Vienna Convention that India had supposedly violated. This was another unsubstantiated allegation in the string of allegations that Trudeau has been making against India. As Canada withdraws it's 40+ diplomats from India after new Delhi sought parity, Canada PM Justin Trudeau alleges violation of Vienna convention. pic.twitter.com/gQuCDDKspgHe added, “It is something that all countries in the world should be very worried about, and this is putting aside the allegations we made of a serious violation of international law with the alleged killing of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil that the Indian government could have been involved in. This is a matter putting that aside that all countries should be concerned about.”Justin Trudeau further said, “The government of India decided to cancel and revoke the diplomatic protection of 40 diplomats working in India. This is something that has far-reaching consequences for the diplomatic world that I know many many countries are very worried about. But it also has very weird impacts on millions of people.”Essentially, in his statement, Justin Trudeau said that he was ‘putting aside’ one lie that he peddled against India (of the killing of Nijjar) just so he could peddle an entirely different lie – both without providing any evidence. Canada Foreign Minister Melanie Joly announced on Thursday (19th October) that Canada has removed 41 diplomats and their 42 family members, from India over the ongoing row between the two countries. She had said, “A unilateral revocation of diplomatic privilege and immunities is contrary to international law. It is a clear violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and threatening to do so is unreasonable and escalatory. If we allow the norm of diplomatic immunity to be broken no diplomats anywhere on the planet would be safe.”On Friday (20th October), the Indian Ministry of External Affairs rejected the Canadian government’s claim that India violated the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations by asking Canada to remove 41 diplomats.In a statement, MEA made it clear, “We have seen the Statement by the Government of Canada on October 19 regarding Canadian diplomatic presence in India. The state of our bilateral relations, the much higher number of Canadian diplomats in India, and their continued interference in our internal affairs warrant a parity in mutual diplomatic presence in New Delhi and Ottawa.”Parity in Canadian diplomatic presence in India:https://t.co/O1fqsrOx8n pic.twitter.com/WxJojOrr5D“We have been engaged with the Canadian side on this over the last month In order to work out the details and modalities of its implementation…Our actions in implementing this parity are fully consistent with Article 11.1 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which states the following,” it further added.Article 11.1 of the Vienna Convention says [pdf], “In the absence of specific agreement as to the size of the mission, the receiving State may require that the size of a mission be kept within limits considered by it to be reasonable and normal, having regard to circumstances and conditions in the receiving State and to the needs of the particular mission.”“We reject any attempt to portray the Implementation of parity as a violation of International norms,” the Indian Ministry of External Affairs clarified in its statement.On On 18th September, in a bizarre move, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau blamed India for killing Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada. This statement by Trudeau stretched the diplomatic relations between India and Canada. Justin Trudeau did not have any solid proof to back his claims. Furthermore, Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly said as a consequence of the allegations, the Canadian government expelled a top Indian diplomat.A month after peddling this lie, Trudeau has asked the world community to “put it aside” while giving the recent statement. What Trudeau is peddling by putting aside the earlier lie is just another lie that India violated the Vienna Convention while revoking the diplomatic immunity of 41 Canadian diplomats.

The video shows Trudeau addressing the dozens gathered, thanking them for allowing him to “pray alongside you in this difficult time,” the daily reported. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was booed while visiting a mosque in Rexdale.

Indian classical singer Ustad Faiyaz Wasifuddin Dagar filed the copyright infringement suit against Rahman at the Delhi High Court. Hearing the case, the high court on Friday ordered Rahman to submit raw recording of the song.Padma Shri awardee Faiyaz Wasifuddin Dagar has alleged that the song ‘Veera Raja Veera’ was copied from the song Shiva Stuti, which was composed by his father Nasir Faiyazuddin Dagar and uncle Zahiruddin Dagar. Dagar filed the plea seeking credit for the song in all platforms whenever the song is played.The court found that there were similarities in the two songs, and asked Oscar awardee AR Rahman to submit the raw version of his song. “You will have to produce your raw recording without the embellishments or computer-generated stuff,” Justice Singh told the counsel representing Rahman. The court said, “there is definitely some kind of similarity in the beat and the taal (rhythm), there is no doubt about it”.After hearing the songs in question, the court said that that it was not making any observations on the dispute at this stage, but added that “there is definitely some kind of similarity in the beat and the taal, there is no doubt about it”.The court said that plaintiff Dagar has attempted to establish infringement with the chart consisting of notations and beat, and Rahman would be required to respond to the same. In order to establish the claim of copyright infringement, Dagar’s counsel filed a chart before court comparing the musical notations of both the songs.Dagar told the court that the rights in all the compositions of his father Nasir Faiyazuddin Dagar and uncle Zahirduddin Dagar belong to him. He said that he is a descendant of the family lineage of Dhrupad vocalists who have been singing in the Dagar Gharana for many generations. “Their style of singing has been described as the Dagar Vani and has a basis in Dhrupad classical music,” Dagar said in the plea.Regarding the song in question, Faiyaz Wasifuddin Dagar claimed that Veera Raja Veera song was based on the Shiva Stuti composition which was composed by his father and his uncle in 1970s. It was performed by Dagar’s father and uncle in various international concerts including the one held at the Royal Tropical Institute in Amsterdam on June 22, 1978.  It was also part of the album Shiva Mahadeva by the Dagar Brothers and produced PAN Records, he told the court.As he owns the rights of their creations, he prayed that an injunction should be granted against AR Rahman, the production companies Madras Talkies and Lyca Productions, and the music record label Tips Industries. He said that while the lyrics are different, both the songs have the same taal and beat, and therefore sought to restrain Rahman and the producers from using the composition.Dagar’s counsel also said that in a brief telephonic conversation between Rahman and Dagar, Rahman had assured that he would try to resolve the issue, but nothing was done.While Rahman’s counsel didn’t make any submission saying he would need to seek instructions, some of the other defendants have rejected the allegation, claiming that it is a traditional song and nobody can claim copyright over it.Madras Talkies claimed that the song was a traditional song and Dagar is only attempting to earn money and gain publicity. they are attempting to arrive at an amicable resolution. Music label Tips Industries said that here was no originality claimed and the mere ‘manner of singing’ cannot be subject matter of copyright. However, they added thatThe court listed the matter November 1 for next hearing.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

His comment was directed at the Indians, who watched the India Vs Pakistan match of the 2023 World Cup live at the Narendra Modi Stadium on 14th October. As expected, the Australian ‘journalist’ was slammed by netizens on social media.Former Indian cricketer Aakash Chopra wrote, “Used to be a well-informed journalist.

Haigh also lied about the farm laws to his predominantly Australian audience and whitewashed anarchy and violence as ‘peaceful protests.’ He cast aspersions on the integrity of Indian cricketers and played the ‘Muslim card’ to draw global sympathy.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The youth Fareed Shah was allegedly attempting to enter the event in order to lure some Hindu girl. For this purpose, he allegedly posed with a fake Hindu identity Ashish. Bajrang Dal members thwarted this attempt to initiate another case of love jihad in the city. A video of the incident went viral on social media.Attorney Neelam Bhargava Ram, the joint convenor of the BJP Legal Cell for the Hyderabad district shared the video and wrote on his X handle, “Finally Hindus in Hyderabad witnessed what Hindu Dharma Rakshak Raja Singh warned about. By hiding his identity a Muslim entered the Dandiya event, and the Hindu Youths caught him and handed him over to the police.”Finally Hindus in Hyderabad witnessed what Hindu Dharma Rakshak @TigerRajaSingh warned about..By hiding identity Muslim entered Dandiya event, Hindu Youth caught and handed over to police…#HinduUnity pic.twitter.com/x4vYmSUqEZIn this video, the Hindu activists are seen inquiring the Muslim youth for his identity proof. They also asked him why he was entering with a false name Ashish. According to reports, the youth was then handed over to the Begumpet police. It is notable that, on 15th October, BJP MLA Raja Singh said, “The holy festival of Navratri has started now. It is considered a very auspicious occasion in our Hindu Dharma and it is a very joyous festival of ours. For nine evenings starting from here to Dashahara, the Navaratri festival and Garba Dandiya are celebrated all over India in various states. Today, I am going to Surat to inaugurate almost 15 different Dandiya festivals. My only message on this occasion is that this Dandiya Utsav is the celebration of our Hindu festival. Non-Hindus should not be allowed to enter the celebration. I am also giving this message to the people of Surat.”इस बार की #नवरात्रि में कई जगहों पर डांडिया उत्सव का कार्यक्रम लगाया जा रहा है…किसी भी गरबा पंडाल में गैर हिन्दुओ का प्रवेश हम नही होने देंगे।जय माता दी।This time during #Navratri, Dandiya festival is being organized at many places.Non-Hindus, regardless of their roles… pic.twitter.com/3T3QgkybDCRaja Singh added, “This is so because we have seen non-Hindus entering the Dandiya events by applying Tlak on their foreheads and targeting our Hindu daughters and sisters for their goal of love jihad. Therefore, it is our duty to spread awareness about this. Therefore, I urge the Dandiya event organisers that non-Hindus should not be allowed to enter the Dandiya celebrations. Aadhar Cards of the persons entering Dandiya celebrations should be checked and they should be made to consume Gomutra. If any non-Hindu enters the Dandiya pandal with the intention of love jihad, he should be beaten with shoes and thrashed away.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

93,"20 October, 2023 ","Indian-origin doctor working at Bahrain hospital operated by Kerala-based group fired for pro-Israel tweets, arrested","Royal Bahrain Hospital is a part of the Indian-based KIMS (Kerala Institute of Medical Sciences) Global which has its headquarters in ThiruvananthapuramAn Indian-origin doctor named Sunil J. Rao has been terminated from his position at a hospital in Bahrain and arrested after posting pro-Israel comments on social media amidst the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict. He was working as a specialist in internal medicine at the Royal Bahrain Hospital in Bahrain’s capital Manama. He wrote a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter) on the ongoing war and expressed support for the Jewish state as it fights with the terrorist group Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Royal Bahrain Hospital issued a statement asserting that the doctor’s “tweets and ideology are personal and do not reflect the opinion and values of the hospital.” It further added, “This is a violation of our code of conduct, and we have taken the necessary legal actions, and his service has been terminated with immediate effect.”pic.twitter.com/RH8SgcumaIRoyal Bahrain Hospital is a private hospital located in the Salmaniya area in Manama. The largest hospital in Bahrain, Salmaniya Medical Complex, is located at Salmaniya, along with several private hospitals including the Royal Bahrain Hospital.According to the country’s Ministry of Interior, the doctor was apprehended by the Anti-Cyber Crimes Directorate. A statement on the government website read, “The Anti-Cyber Crimes Directorate of the General Directorate of Anti-Corruption and Economic and Electronic Security announced the summon of an Asian, 50, for posting tweets on X platform containing insults of a religious nature, in violation of civil peace and social stability that could affect society’s security and safety. The Asian was arrested and legal proceedings are being taken to refer the case to the Public Prosecution.”He had already apologised for his remarks before the hospital’s response. He referred to his utterances as “insensitive” and conveyed, “As a doctor all lives matter. I respect this country its people and its religion deeply as I have been here for the past 10 years.”I would like to apologized about the statement that I posted on this platform.It was insensitive in the context of the current event. As a doctor all lives matter. I respect this country its people and its religion deeply as I have been here for past 10 years.كلماتي و افعاليThe remarks were brought to the attention of Bahraini authorities by a user named Tanvir Ansari who highlighted the doctor’s religion in order to provoke his co-religionists and alleged, “This is a Hindu doctor working in Bahrain. He believes that Islam is a barbaric religion, Muslims are attacking Israel and Palestinians must be destroyed.” He tagged the country’s Ministry of Interior as well as the Information and e-Government Authority and asked them to “take note.”Notably, the individual’s original account is blocked in India and he made the demand from a backup account which has a picture of Sharjeel Imam who called upon people to “agitate and cut off Assam and the Northeast from the rest of India” at an anti-CAA protest in 2020 and is presently behind bars. He was one of the faces behind the major Shaheen Bagh protest.What the doctor actually postedIt is important to note that the doctor’s tweets were misrepresented by the extremist Muslim who twisted his words to portray him as anti-Muslim and against Palestine. He had merely denounced the terrorist attack on the civilians perpetrated by the terrorist outfit which left at least 1300 Israelis dead and thousands of others wounded including women babies and the elderly. Hamas also took hundreds of hostages comprising kids with them to use as bargaining chips in the violent dispute. “#IsraelFightBack will do a scorched earth attack, plenty will be killed, displaced, Hamas will be destroyed (rightly so), then what? If I may ask,” he asked. His post was clearly anti-Hamas and wasn’t directed at Muslims or Palestine as it was deftly misrepresented by the radical Muslims to incite religious sensitivities.He also reacted to a post by an Arab internet personality Loay Alshareef and voiced, “This is a very important question to answer, what is a proportional response? Which world religion allows for what was done to the Israelis? No whataboutery will help. What is proportionality? Capitulation in front of #HamasTerrporist?” He criticised the terror group for using religion as a tool to perpetuate heinous crimes against humanity and sided with Israel and its right to defend itself and retaliate after the unprecedented assault on its people. Freedom of expression: Indians Muslims vs Hindus in Islamic CountriesThere are unfair disparities when it comes to freedom of expression for Muslims living in India and Hindus staying in the Middle East. The former has the right to exploit the liberty and even to the point of abusing the latter and mocking their religion. Their vitriolic onslaught against the majority population knows no bounds, ranging from Muslim leaders to ordinary community members.They share their disrespectful views on everyone from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to common Hindus, however, the same courtesy is not extended to Hindus in Islamic nations. All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) MLA Akbaruddin Owaisi who is the younger brother of party President Asaduddin Owaisi infamously announced in 2013 that if police were removed for 15 minutes, we (Muslims) would finish 100 crore Hindus. The comments gained him notoriety, but he continues to enjoy a public life and is an influential politician in his community.The same sentiment was echoed by another leader and spokesperson of the party named Waris Pathan who issued a veiled threat in 2020 and declared, “We are 15 crores but be aware we can still dominate over 100 crore Hindus and imagine what we can do to you.”Last year, Bharatiya Janata Party’s Nupur Sharma had to face death threats for merely responding to Taslim Ahmed Rehmani who was repeatedly making fun of Shivling in a debate on the disputed structure in Gyanvapi. She had quoted from revered Islamic texts but an edited video from the programme was later shared by regular fake news peddler Mohammed Zubair to dog whistle Islamists against her which resulted in “Sar Tan Se Juda” (beheading) protests across the country and multiple Hindus including Kanhaiya Lal from Udaipur, and Umesh Kolhe from Amravati lost their lives to fundamentalist Muslims. Nupur Sharma has been forced to spend her life in secrecy since then while Taslim Ahmed Rehmani carried on to appear on debate shows and faced no repercussions for his bigoted comments.The Chinese-funded Newslaundry columnist and extremist Sharjeel Usmani who casually calls Hindus “Sada Hua Samaj” (rotten community) equated ‘Jai Shree Ram’ to a war cry and alleged, that people who chanted the religious slogan were nothing but terrorists. He had termed Hindu society as completely rotten in a speech in 2021 while simultaneously claiming victimhood and oppression.These are only a handful of instances of blatant Hinduphobia which is ever present on social media and in day-to-day life which is mostly incentivised and rarely challenged in the name of freedom of expression. Hindus, on the other hand, do not enjoy the same privileges and are always in danger of losing their lives or jobs due to Islamists.The world is aware of the persecution of Hindus in Muslim-majority neighbouring states of India for being non-Muslims. The Hindus who live in the Gulf countries are at risk of losing their livelihoods and what they have worked for because their statement does not align with the expectations or displeases the majority community of that nation or their coreligionist in any part of the world as evident by the recent occurrence. Meanwhile, fanatic Indian Muslims who harbour bigotry and hatred towards Hindus continue to offend and insult the majority population with near impunity, and they seldom ever face any repercussions for their actions.Royal Bahrain Hospital and its ties with India’s KIMS GlobalThe Royal Bahrain Hospital is a part of the Indian-based KIMS (Kerala Institute of Medical Sciences) Global which has its headquarters in Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Kerala. The healthcare organisation operates numerous hospitals and medical facilities throughout South India and the Gulf region.It started off as KIMS Hospital, a multi-speciality hospital in Trivandrum which was launched in 2002 and expanded as the KIMS Global which went through an expansion in 2013 and opened centres in other parts of the state, Kollam, Kottayam, Perinthalmanna, and Kochi as well as in the Middle East, in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, United Arab Emirates, and Dubai.Now the group has 23 hospitals and medical centres in several counties.

94,"20 October, 2023 ",Ghaziabad: ABES College professor throws student off stage for greeting audiences with ‘Jai Shri Ram’ at cultural fest; videos go viral,"""Why did you raise the slogan of Jai Shri Ram? Do you come to the college for this? This is a cultural program. This cannot be allowed. Out. Get Out,"" an ABES professor told off a student after he greeted the audiences with 'Jai Shri Ram' slogan. On the 20th of October, a student from ABES College of Engineering in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, found themselves reprimanded by an assistant professor during a college cultural festival and student induction program. The professor, identified as Mamata Gautam by social media users, scolded the student for greeting the audience with a courteous “Jai Shri Ram.”The incident came to the fore after the video of a professor, purportedly Gautam, yelling at the student went viral over the internet. Gautam scolded the student saying, “Why did you raise the slogan of Jai Shri Ram? Do you come to the college for this? This is a cultural program. This cannot be allowed. Out. Get Out.” Meanwhile, the student said that he was just responding to the ‘Jai Shri Ram’ calls from the audience. Mamata Gautam, a teacher from ABES Engineering college in Ghaziabad expelled a student from stage for greeting audience with ""Jai Shree Ram"". The student was about to perform at the College Cultural Fest. @ABESEC032 should explain Bharat me Jai Shree Ram nahi bolenge to kya… pic.twitter.com/kvN3NGVcQ0The video vividly captures several students on stage greeting the individual with “Jai Shri Ram,” to which the person on stage responded with the same phrase. After this, the entire college stadium very delightfully cheered ‘Jai Shri Ram’ which irked Mamata Gautam who stood from her seat and expelled the student from the stage. The incident, as per the viral video, seems to have happened during a college cultural fest named ‘Navtarang 2023-24’. The program was also organized for the welcome of the BTech first-year students at the ABES College of Engineering, Ghaziabad. The videos sparked online outrage, with a raft of netizens calling for punishing the teacher for unnecessarily slamming the student who responded to the audience with ‘Jai Shri Ram’ greeting. “This needs an Investigation. The student should be reinstated ASAP,” said one of the users. Meanwhile, the other one said that the incident exposed people hiding for years in the garb of secularism.Dr Mamata Gautam, as per the official website of ABES College of Engineering, Ghaziabad has 16 years of experience and specialises in Chemistry. She has a PhD and has been working with the college as one of the Assistant Professors. OpIndia’s team attempted to contact the institute to confirm the incident and inquire about the matter, but their calls went unanswered. Nonetheless, one of the assistant professors who requested anonymity over the matter said he had “no comments” on the matter. A student with whom OpIndia spoke was reluctant to share information about the matter. He also claimed that he does not whether Mamata Gautam was a teacher at the institute or not. However, one of the representatives of the faculty members confirmed that Mamata Gautam was indeed a faculty at the institute. The representative, though, remained cagey about the incident, claiming that he knew nothing about the matter.OpIndia has sent an email to the institute and the said professor over their stand on the incident, the response to which will be updated in the report as and when they respond.The Ghaziabad Police has taken cognisance over the matter after the video had gone viral and launched a preliminary investigation into the incident.थाना प्रभारी क्रासिंग रिपब्लिक को जाँच कर आवश्यक कार्यवाही हेतु निर्देशित किया गया है |Notably, the divine chant of ‘Jai Shri Ram’ has been wrongly portrayed as a ‘war cry’ by several ‘seculars’ and ‘liberals’ time and again. However, varied Islamist slogans like ‘Sar Tan Se Juda’ which is a literal call for beheading, or ‘Allah-hu-Akhbar’ are never addressed by these people with the condemning tone they actually deserve. It is necessary to take an account how a non-violent simple Dharmic chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’ is demeaned as a provocative slogan as opposed to several dreadful Islamist slogans that are ignored and usually get a free pass. It has been observed that the ‘liberals’ and ‘seculars’ widely use the sacred ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogan to defame Hindus and portray them as hateful. The ‘liberals’ have deep-rooted hatred towards Hindus and they have been targeting, and demeaning Hindus over the divine chant especially since the BJP, known for its Hindutva beliefs, came to power in 2014. OpIndia has recorded several such incidents in which the ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogan was misused to turn a random crime into a ‘hate crime’. The said report can be read here.

96,"20 October, 2023 ","Big-shot lawyers and billionaire tycoons, a jilted-ex and a dog: The leading characters in the ‘luxury gifts for questions’ story of Mahua Moitra","This story has drama, infatuation, separation, politics, business, emotions, and whatnot. The expensive gifts allegedly received by Mahua Moitra have raised the budget of the story.TMC MP Mahua Moitra’s alleged scandal of getting favours for questioning against Gautam Adani in the parliament has become the talk of the town for the past few days. But what emerged during the rounds of accusations and counter-accusations between Mahua Moitra, her collaborator-turned-approver Darshan Hiranandani and Mahua Moitra’s former ‘close aide’ advocate Jai Anant Dehadrai is not less than a prime-time ‘saas-bahu’ drama typically seen on ay Indian TV channel. This story has drama, infatuation, separation, politics, business, emotions, and whatnot. The expensive gifts allegedly received by Mahua Moitra have raised the budget of the story. This whole story has a ‘Samdhi’ angle, a ‘bhai’ angle, and most importantly a so-called ‘jilted ex’. Readers may recall a song at the end of the story – ‘Thukra ke mera pyar mera intekam dekhegi’ meaning you will see my revenge after rejecting my love. Besides, there is a journalist Sucheta Dalal who is asking the TMC MP back – Hum Aapke Hain Kaun? – only after writing articles praising the accused lady crusader. There is also a cute little dog who has lost everything in the turn of events. This dog once enjoyed its life in the laps of a democratically elected lady lawmaker showering kisses on the pup. Now this dog has become the subject of a heated custody battle and has been reduced to a topic of some petty police FIRs over the veracity of its ownership and allegations of theft. So, without wasting a moment, let us dive into the details of the complicated relationships in this story as intriguing as some daily soap serial.People may call ‘jilted ex’ a ‘bhadka hua ashiq’ in Hindi. But for the premise of this story, we will go by the classical definition. If someone is jilted, the person they are having a romantic relationship with suddenly ends the relationship in a surprising and upsetting way. Mahua Moitra has called advocate Jai Anant Dehadrai her ‘jilted ex’.The story starts with advocate Jai Anant Dehadrai writing a letter to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Lok Sabha MP Nishikant Dubey. In this letter, Dehadrai made some startling revelations about TMC MP Mahua Moitra, claiming that she was paid to ask questions in Lok Sabha targetting the Adani Group. Based on this letter, the BJP MP sent a formal complaint to the Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla seeking an inquiry against Moitra and urging the Speaker for her immediate suspension. The reasons for such demands by the lawyer were revealed in the chapter where this all story was broken.On 15th October, Nishikant Dubey levelled serious allegations of bribery against Trinamool MP Mahua Moitra, based on details provided by advocate Jai Anant Dehadrai. In his complaints, Advocate Dehadrai alleged that Moitra was paid in cash and gifts for asking questions in Parliament that favoured tycoon Darshan Hiranandani’s business interests primarily against Gautam Adani. Following the allegations, Mahua Moitra claimed that a “jilted” ex was framing her, referring to the advocate.Mr A – this lame statement your best efforts? Falling back on Fake Degree MP & a jilted ex’s lies? I won’t rest till @dir_ed , @CBItweets investigate & freeze ₹13000 cr coal scam you have stolen from Indians.I’m told even Hon’ble @narendramodi is sick of you & your frauds. pic.twitter.com/sfwsmJEKftOn 16th October (Monday), the Adani Group released an official statement reiterating that some groups and individuals, both inside and outside India, have been engaged in a smear campaign to besmirch the repute and harm the interests of the Adani Group. In the official letter, the Adani group spokesperson highlighted reports that indicated a “quid pro quo” between Member of Parliament Mahua Moitra and Darshan Hiranandani, CEO of Hiranandani Group. Mahua Moitra’s X post regarding the ‘jilted ex’ came in response to the same press release by the Adani Group. In this post, she called Gautam Adani ‘Mr A’ which further adds spice to the story.In response to the formal complaint submitted to the Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla by Nishikant Dubey, seeking an inquiry against Mahua Moitra, the TMC MP sent a legal notice to the BJP Lok Sabha MP and advocate and her former “personal friend” Jai Anant Dehadrai and a multiple media organisations for allegedly ‘defaming’ her.BJP MP Nishikant Dubey writes a letter to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla demanding to constitute an inquiry committee against TMC MP Mahua Moitra and her 'immediate suspension' from the House alleging that 'bribes were exchanged between her and businessman Darshan Hiranandani to ask… pic.twitter.com/pbqlMgbCvDMahua Moitra claimed that Nishikant Dubey went against her interest because she had doubted his educational credentials in the past. On advocate Jai Anant Dehadrai, she claimed that they were once “close friends” but after a falling out, Dehadrai allegedly repeatedly threatened Moitra with several vile, malicious and vulgar messages, trespassed on her official residence, stole personal belongings, including Moitra’s dog.In what turned out to be a huge blow to the TMC MP, Darshan Hiranandani reportedly decided to become an approver in this case. In a statement issued by Hiranandani on 19th October, the billionaire businessman accepted paying for most of the questions asked by Mahua Moitra in the Lok Sabha in the form of cash and gifts. He also acknowledged that the TMC MP provided him with her Parliamentary login credentials which he used to ask questions to the central government on her behalf. Darshan Hiranandani turns approver, corroborates Jai Anant Dehadrai. pic.twitter.com/oXk7NeGQwvHiranandani also said that Mahua Moitra was getting unverified information to target Gautam Adani from various people, including journalist Sucheta Dalal and lawyers Shardul Shroff and Pallavi Shroff. Darshan Hiranandani is the son of Indian billionaire businessman Niranjan Hiranandani and holds a key position in his father’s real estate empire. Darshan Hiranandani is significantly engaged in managing the group’s international real estate ventures. The top real estate firm has been diversifying into other sectors, and many of them directly compete with Adani Group companies. This includes data centres, cloud computing, energy, and industrial warehousing.His statement came a day after Lok Sabha Secretariat’s Privileges & Ethics Branch issued letters to Advocate Jai Anant Dehadrai and Bharatiya Janata Party MP Nishikant Dubey to submit evidence against Mahua Moitra. Darshan Hiranandani’s statement revealed that he was also impressed by the qualities of the TMC MP. He wrote, “I found her to be knowledgable, expressive and outspoken. We exchanged contact details and remained in touch ever since. Over a period of time, she has been a close personal friend of mine. In the course of my interactions with her, I found her to be a bright intellectual and one of the public representatives who thoroughly understands both the economy and business matters. We used to communicate frequently on the telephone, ranging from weekly to daily calls. We frequently met when I came to India or when she visited Dubai.”A dominating Saas (mother-in-law) is often seen in the TV serials. Here, besides estranged close friend of the advocate, Mahua Moitra also played a dominating lady. This added more interesting things to the story.Darshan Hiranandani wrote in his statement, “As our interactions grew over time, she started asking for odds and ends which involved my time. Once she asked you for something, it was always a ‘drop everything and do it now for me’ approach. She was dominating by nature and assertive in her temperament. She would always say, it was always urgent and critical for her and would slowly take control of your time. It was a way of reeling in your interest and in some way controlling some of your actions.”Darshan Hiranandani said in his statement, “Ms Moitra, in her endeavour, was getting help from other people like Sucheta Dalal, Shardul Shroff and Pallavi Shroff, who were also in touch with her, and who was feeding her with all kinds of unverified information relating to Gautam Adani and his companies.” This is how the names were introduced in the story. Hiranandani also claimed that Moitra was interacting with Rahul Gandhi over the Adani issue and “bonded extremely well” with Shashi Tharoor and Pinaki Mishra adding more names to the complex story.To understand the next plot of the story, it is necessary to first know that Shardul Shroff is the brother of Cyril Shroff. Pallavi Shroff is the wife of Shardul Shroff. Cyril Shroff is the father-in-law of Gautam Adani’s son Karan Adani. So, Cyril and Shardul are sons of Suresh Amarchand Shroff, a former managing partner of the law firm Amarchand & Mangaldas & Suresh A Shroff & Co. His grandfather started the firm in partnership with Mangaldas Mehta in 1917. Cyril Shroff and Gautam Adani are samdhis, as Gautam Adani’s son Karan Adani is married to Cyril Shroff’s daughter Paridhi Shroff. Cyril Shroff and his brother Shardul Shroff were managing partners of Amarchand Mangaldas & Suresh A Shroff & Co, a top law firm. However, there was a rivalry between the two brothers over the firm, and they decided in 2015 to split the company. Shardul Shroff now runs Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co, while Cyril Shroff runs Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, India’s largest full-services law firm. The brothers and their respective wives are among the top corporate lawyers in the country. Mahua Moitra’s response to Darshan Hiranandani’s statement revealed her version of the story as well as some new sub-tracks in this Mahuagate. Mahua Moitra wrote, “Shardul Shroff is the brother of Cyril Shroff who has had a bitter separation of business from him.”After explaining this Bhai angle, she went ahead to explain the Samdhi angle, as she wrote, “Cyril Shroff is Gautam Adani’s “samdhi” and was on the SEBI’s committee in total conflict of interest. Rahul Gandhi and Shashi Tharoor are both people the government targets relentlessly. Sucheta Dalal is an investigative journalist who is always exposing the government.”Mahua Moitra also mentioned that as all these names were allegedly unfavourable to the ruling party and the Prime Minister, Darshan Hiranandani’s statement was drafted by someone working in the PMO in order to implicate all of them at once as this would be the best opportunity to do so.In her latest statement, Mahua Moitra went on to reveal more about her “jilted ex” advocate Jai Anant Dehadrai. She wrote, “This BJP government has been waiting to somehow shut me up on the Adani issue desperately. Jai Dehadrai is not some “Supreme Court lawyer” who has done painstaking research on me. He is a jilted ex with an acrimonious personal history with me who wanted to somehow get back at me. If indeed he was witness to all of my corruption why was he with me during the time and why did he wait till now to make it public?”However, Mahua Moitra did not clarify much about the exact nature and reason for the acrimony that developed between her and her former close friend advocate Jai Anant Dehadrai. Meanwhile, media reports were flooded with Mahua Moitra’s photographs with Jai Anant Dehadrai where both are seen sharing a cigar. Both of them looked comfortable in the image, and no sign of any acrimony was noticed.In a legal notice sent to Jai Ananat Dehadrai, Mahua Moitra alleged that the lawyer took away many of her belongings including a dog named Henry. The feud between TMC MP Mahua Moitra and her ‘jilted ex’ advocate Jai Anant Dehadrai got murkier with the duo fighting over the custody of this dog. Three days after the TMC MP sent a legal notice to her former personal friend accusing him of stealing her dog, Dehadrai wrote to the Delhi police commissioner accusing Mahua Moitra of stealing and hiding his pet dog Henry.Heartless | TMC MP in RowAn emotional dog parent Jai Dehadrai tells Delhi Police: My bond with my dog Henry is of parent – child.

Dehadrai also included proof of purchase documentation for the Rottweiler breed dog. These documents comprised a payment receipt, a litter’s registration certificate, and details on the litter’s microchip. Meanwhile, the social media was flooded with various videos in which Mahua Moitra was seen kissing the dog.On Thursday (19th October), journalist Sucheta Dalal denied knowing Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra and helping her in targeting the Adani Group with unverified information. The development came hours after Darshan Hiranandani, the CEO of Hiranandani Group, turned approver in the ‘cash for query’ scandal (also called ‘MahuaGate’) and accused Dalal of aiding Moitra in defaming the Adani Group.In a tweet, the ‘journalist claimed, “The very fact that he has named me makes this whole letter and his ‘solemn’ statements a farce — I don’t know Mahua Moitra and I think she can confirm it. The question of helping her simply does not arise, NOR did she EVER reach out and ask for any help either!”Dear @bhupendrachaube — the very fact that he has named me makes this whole letter and his 'solemn' statements a farce — I don't know @MahuaMoitra – and I think she can confirm it. The question of helping her simply does not arise, NOR did she EVER reach out and ask for any… https://t.co/YEsXTTFLNtSeveral netizens pointed out that Sucheta Dalal, who claimed to not know Mahua Moitra personally, had sent information to the Trinamool Congress MP with respect to Essar Group. They shared a screenshot of the interaction between the journalist and the politician, who is now under fire over the ‘cash for query’ scandal.Sucheta Dalal however claimed that the Twitter interaction was no proof of her personal comaraderie with Mahua Moitra. OpIndia accessed a copy of the complaint filed by Adv Dehadrai that contained a list of items that Moitra allegedly got in exchange for asking questions in the Parliament. These expensive gifts soared the budget of the Mahua drama. Apart from luxury items, Advocate Dehadrai claimed Moitra received regular packets of cash in Indian Rupees and Pound Sterling. He further claimed to have seen her counting 20,000 pounds sterling at her residence. A detailed account of the expensive items received by the TMC MP can be read here.So far, this story has taken many twists and turns of allegations, rebuttals, and emotional breakouts. It remains to be seen how it proceeds further as the Privileges & Ethics Branch of the Lok Sabha Secretariat has yet to hear and record the statements of the parties involved.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

97,"20 October, 2023 ","‘Samdhi, bhai, and the jilted ex’: Know what Mahua Moitra is alluding to in her statement that brings a ‘saas-bahu’ style drama to the whole affair"," Cyril Shroff is the Samdhi of Gautam Adani, and Shardul Shroff, who is accused of giving unverified allegations against Adani to Mahua Moitram, is the bhai or brother of Cyril ShroffDays after BJP MP Nishikant Dubey wrote to the Lok Sabha speaker seeking a probe against TMC MP Mahua Moitra accusing her of taking luxury gifts for asking questions in Lok Sabha, things have rapidly escalated for the West Bengal politician. First, it was revealed that Dupey’s allegations were based on information provided to him by advocate Jai Anant Dehadrai, former partner of Mohua Moitra.After that, the statement by Dehadrai appeared in public, giving detailed accounts of the allegations against Moitra. He said that Mahua Moitra received expensive gifts and other benefits from business tycoon Darshan Hiranandani, in exchange for asking questions in parliament targeting Gautam Adani, Hiranandani’s business rival in several sectors.It was also alleged that Mahua Moitra had provided her Lok Sabha portal’s login credentials, allowing him to post questions directly on her behalf. While the TMC MP had denied the charges, things exploded on 19 October, when Darshan Hiranandani himself issued a statement, confirming the allegations. He confirmed that he was given Mahua Moitra’s Parliament login and password to post questions. Hiranandani also confirmed that he had given luxury gifts to Moitra, paid for her holidays and travels, helped her in renovating her house etc.The real estate tycoon said that Mohua Moitra chose to target Gautam Adani to attack Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as there was nothing to target the PM directly. Adding to the allegations, Darshan Hiranandani alleged that Mahua Moitra was getting unverified information from several people to target Adani. He specifically mentioned three names, Sucheta Dalal, Shardul Shroff and Pallavi Shroff. Here, Sucheta Dalal is a well-known journalist, while Shardul Shroff and Pallavi Shroff are advocates.Mahua Moitra has issued a statement in response to Hiranandani’s statement, alleging that he was forced to issue the statement by putting a gun to his head. However, she didn’t refute charges that she had given him her Lok Sabha login ID and password and also didn’t deny getting gifts from him and asking questions based on his inputs. She added that Cyril Shroff, brother of Shadul Shoff mentioned by Hiranandani, is the Samdhi of Gautam Adani, and the two brothers had a bitter separation of the business. Before mentioning this Samdhi and his Bhai (brother), Moitra had also mentioned her ‘jilted-ex’. Here are the concerned persons and their links to the entire story.Shardul Shroff and Pallavi Shroff are lawyers, and they run one of the largest law firms in India, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co. Shardul Shroff is the Executive Chairman and his wife Pallavi Shroff is the Managing Partner of the law firm, and interestingly, they have an Adani connection. Especially, they were in a bitter fight with Shardul’s brother over the law firm, and that brother is a relative of Gautam Adani.Shardul Shroff and his brother Cyril Shroff were managing partners of Amarchand Mangaldas & Suresh A Shroff & Co, a top law firm. However, there was a rivalry between the two brothers over the firm, and they decided in 2015 to split the company. They reached a settlement following mediation and decided that they would split the law firm established in 1917 by their grandfather.The dispute was the result of the will by their mother Bharati Shroff, who had handed over her entire share in the law firm to Shardul Shroff. Shardul Shroff had moved the Delhi High Court seeking implementation of the will, triggering a bitter war between the brothers.However, they finally decided to settle the matter by signing a Family Framework Agreement. According to this agreement, the shares of their mother were divided equally between them. As a result of the settlement, Cyril Shroff chose to not contest the implementation of the will, and Shardul Shroff chose to not go ahead with the lawsuit seeking implementation of the will.Accordingly, Shardul Shroff now runs Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co, while Cyril Shroff runs Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, India’s largest full-services law firm. Now that Darshan Hiranandani has accused Shardul Shroff and his wife Pallavi Shroff of helping Mahua Moitra in the campaign against Gautam Adani by feeding unverified information, it becomes interesting to note that Shardul’s brother Cyril is related to Gautam Adani.Paridhi Shroff is the daughter of Cyril Shroff and his lawyer wife Vandana Shroff. Paridhi is married to Karan Adani, the elder son of Gautam Adani. Therefore, Gautam Adani and Cyril Shroff are Samdhis, the Hindi word for fathers of spouses.Karan Adani married Paridhi Shroff in a high-profile wedding ceremony in 2013, which was attended by several well-known guests including Mukesh Ambani and Anand Mahindra. Paridhi Shroff is also a lawyer and is a partner at Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas.Given the proximity of Cyril Shroff’s family with Adani and also with his brother, it is possible that Shardul Shroff and Pallavi Shroff had obtained information about the Adani group through Cyril’s firm, which then they passed on to Mahua Moitra.Hence, there are several people involved in the story involving the ‘gift for questions’ charges against Mahua Moitra. There is Cyril Shroff, the Samdhi of Gautam Adani, and Shardul Shroff, who is the bhai or brother of Cyril Shroff.There is also a ‘jilted-ex’ in the story, who is none other than advocate Jai Anant Dehadrai, who unfolded the entire scam. Mahua Moitra has described him as her ‘jilted ex’, acknowledging their previous relationship. She alleged that the allegations against her were based on lies of a ‘jilted ex’.There is also a dog in the story, named Henry. Apparently, both Mahua Moitra and Jai Anant Dehadrai are claiming ownership of this pet dog. Dehadrai has alleged that he had bought the dog, and now his ex Mahua Moitra has stolen it. He has even written to the Delhi police, seeking to get the Rottweiler dog back from the TMC MP. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

98,"20 October, 2023 ","After allegations of accepting bribes for asking questions, sharing Lok Sabha login credentials, Mahua Moitra plays victim, questions Ethics Committee ‘leak’","Earlier in the day, the TMC MP welcomed the Lok Sabha Ethics Committee enquiry into the 'Cash for Query' scandal and said that she is ready to answer the questions of the panel when the Committee calls her. Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra on Friday alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) agenda is to expel me from the Lok Sabha. “Chairman Ethics Committee openly speaks to media. Please see the Lok Sabha rules below. How does an “affidavit” find its way to media? Chairman should first do an enquiry into how this was leaked. I repeat – BJP 1 point agenda is to expel me from LS to shut me up on Adani,” Moitra posted on X (Formerly Twitter).Moreover, Vinod Sonkar, Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee of Ethics on Friday informed that he has received an affidavit from the businessman Darshan Hiranandani regarding the ‘Cash for Query’ scandal which mentions the alleged role played by TMC MP Mahua Moitra in this row. “I have received a letter/affidavit from Darshan Hiranandani,” Ethics Panel chairman Sonkar said. “In his 3-page signed affidavit to the Ethics panel, Darshan Hiranandani had admitted to his friendship with the TMC MP Mahua Moitra and claimed that the Lok Sabha Member saw attacking the Adani group as a route to fame, She became Lok Sabha MP in May 2019. She was advised by her friends that the shortest route to fame was by attacking Narendra Modi. She thought that the only way to attack PM Modi was by attacking Gautam Adani and his group as they both come from Gujarat,” Hiranandani’s affidavit read. Hiranandani had further claimed that Mahua Moitra did share her Parliament Login credentials with him. “She knew that Indian Oil Corporation was getting into an arrangement with Dhamra LNG a joint venture of the Adani group…..She drafted few questions that she could raise in parliament that would have elements to embarrass the Govt and target the Adani group. She shared with me her email ID as MP, so I could send her information and she could raise the questions. I went along with her proposal,” the affidavit read. Hiranandani also claims that the TMC MP also demanded favours and gifts from him. Earlier in the day, the TMC MP welcomed the Lok Sabha Ethics Committee enquiry into the ‘Cash for Query’ scandal and said that she is ready to answer the questions of the panel when the Committee calls her. In a post on X (former Twitter), Mahua Moitra said,” I welcome answering questions to the CBI and Ethics Committee (which has an absolute majority of BJP members) if and when they call me. I have neither time nor interest to feed an Adani-directed media circus trial or answer BJP trolls. I am enjoying Durga Puja in Nadia. Shubho Sashthi.” Meanwhile, Advocate Jai Anant Dehadrai in a post on X, alleged that attempts were made towards him to withdraw his complaint registered at the Central Bureau of Investigation. “An attempt was made yesterday afternoon, to coerce me into withdrawing my CBI complaint and letter to Nishikant Dubey, in exchange for Henry (his dog). I flatly refused – will give details to CBI. Messenger is totally innocent – but tells you everything about her,” the Advocate went on to say in what appears to be a dig at TMC MP Mahua Moitra against whom the allegations of ‘Cash for Query’ have been made. According to BJP MP Nishikant Dubey’s complaint to the Parliament Ethics Committee, Advocate Dehadrai had provided him proof of TMC MP Mahua Moitra’s involvement in the alleged ‘Cash for Query’ scandal. Earlier businessman, Darshan Hiranandani, who was allegedly behind the said payoffs in the ‘Cash for Query’ scandal responded in a 3-page affidavit and claimed that the Mahua Moitra saw attacking the Adani group as a route to fame. Questioning the credibility of Darshan Hiranandani’s affidavit, TMC MP Mahua Moitra said, “The affidavit is on white paper, and not an official letterhead or notarized. Why would one of India’s most respected/educated businessmen sign a letter like this on white paper unless a gun was put on his head to do it? “The contents of the letter are a joke. It has clearly been drafted by some half-wit in the PMO who doubles up as a creative writer in the BJP’s IT cell. It sings paeans to Modi and Gautam Adani while linking every opponent of theirs to me and my alleged corruption,” Moitra alleged. Alleging that Businessman Hiranandani was “compelled” to sign the letter, Moitra said, “The PMO held a proverbial gun to Darshan and his father’s heads and gave them 20 minutes to sign this letter sent to them. They were threatened with a total shutdown of all their businesses. They were told they would be finished, the CBI would raid them and all government business would stop and all PSU bank financing would be stopped immediately.” Earlier Nishikant Dubey in his letter to the Lok Sabha Speaker, titled “Re-emergence of nasty ‘Cash for Query’ in Parliament” had alleged “‘serious Breach of Privilege’, ‘Contempt of the House’ and a ‘Criminal Offence’ under Section 120A of IPC” by the Trinamool Congress MP. Dubey claimed that an Advocate, Jai Anant Dehadrai had provided him with proof of a bribe. In her response to this letter the TMC MP had said that she would welcome a probe by the speaker after he dealt with alleged breach of privilege by other BJP MPs. (This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

100,"20 October, 2023 ","Amid the India-Canada standoff, India has, under the leadership of PM Modi, made it clear that we are no more a pushover nation","Besides India's stern approach towards Canada, it's neutral stance over the Russia-Ukraine war and India's strong retaliation to China's Galwan misadventure, that has strongly signalled to the world that the days of India caving in to pressure from world powers are long gone by. On Friday, October 20, Canada withdrew 41 diplomats and their families from India. The move came after India gave an ultimatum for revoking the diplomatic immunity of those diplomats who stayed back post-10th of October even after being told to leave.Diplomatic ties between India and Canada nose-dived after Canada prematurely expelled an Indian diplomat on the 19th of September following baseless allegations by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of the involvement of Indian agents in the murder of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. India went on to promptly expel a Canadian diplomat in a tit-for-tat response to Ottawa’s expulsion of an Indian official over the case. New Delhi also suspended visa services for Canadian nationals.The chill in relations between the two countries was even evident at the G20 Leaders’ Summit in New Delhi on September 9 and 10, so much so that even local Canadian media chastised its Prime Minister for being overlooked by Indian and other foreign leaders during the G20 Summit.As the bilateral relations between Canada and India worsen, several reports suggest that Canada has been desperately trying to diffuse the diplomatic row with India. India, on its part, has made it clear that it is no longer a pushover nation and would not tolerate acts of aggression, hate, and intimidation from the rest of the world. The Western big powers like the US, Russia and the UK have also when it came to the India-Canada standoff, chosen to steer clear of strongly-worded public statements that would antagonise India, fearing diplomatic backlash from one of the fastest-growing countries in the world and regarded as a potential counterweight to an increasingly assertive China. This is why, when the Canadian Prime Minister sought the support of many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, to raise the issue with India he was snubbed by everyone fearing diplomatic backlash from India.The USA, which has a habit of interfering in every nation’s domestic affairs, was also compelled to toe a fine diplomatic line when it came to the India-Canada standoff. While avoiding offending Canada, one of its closest allies, it did not dare to oppose India. This is primarily because, India, in recent years, has advanced to a position where it is seen as a crucial defence partner for the United States and an essential counterweight to China.The West, including Canada, also has other major things to consider when it comes to India, including strong defence and trade ties that both sides would rather see maintained and strengthened.Another major reason why the Western nations haven’t taken sides may be that they are aware that India’s demand for parity in mutual diplomatic presence does not violate any international rules. In fact, when Canada accused India of flouting the Vienna Convention in withdrawing diplomatic immunity from 41 Canadian diplomats, India strongly responded to Canada’s statement on the withdrawal of some of its diplomats following India’s prod and said no international norm was violated seeking parity in the mutual diplomatic presence in New Delhi and Ottawa. Basically, the Canadian presence in India is much more than India’s presence in Canada. Therefore, India has asked Canada to take back the excess diplomats so that it is equal to Indian diplomats in Canada.Moreover, the West is also completely aware that India is well aware that it has the upper hand and that, if it chooses, it can turn the faucet off and hurt Canada where it hurts the most.The majority of overseas students studying in Canada are from India. According to statistics provided by the Canadian government, around 40% of the 8 lakh international students studying in Canada at the moment are from India. Indian students pay three to five times more in tuition than Canadians do at private colleges. In a sense, Indians support the entire Canadian private college ecosystem, which will disintegrate if the Indian government decides to stop the outflow. Moreover, as many as 600 Canadian companies, including Bombardier and SNC Lavalin, have a strong presence in India, while more than 30 Indian companies, such as infotech majors TCS, Infosys and Wipro have invested billions of dollars in Canada, creating thousands of jobs.The above multiple reasons might have also compelled Canada to change its rhetorics. On Tuesday, October 17, Trudeau and Foreign Minister Melanie Joly indicated that they did not want to fuel tensions with India by speaking about them publicly — a sharp contrast with the open claims against India that the prime minister made in parliament.It is, however, not just in reference to how India has been handling the India-Canada standoff but there are other recent bold decisions India has taken under the leadership of PM Modi like maintaining a neutral stance over the Russia-Ukraine war and India’s strong retaliation to China’s Galwan misadventure, that has strongly signalled to the world that India has a mind of its own and that the days of India caving in to pressure from world powers are long gone by.When Modi initially took office as Prime Minister in May 2014, nobody anticipated this three-time Chief Minister of Gujarat and outsider to Lutyens’ Delhi would become the nation’s top diplomat and steer foreign affairs like a gifted artist. But like in other areas, PM Modi took the initiative and crafted a new multi-dimensional foreign policy of multiple allegiances and issue-based allegiances, which has elevated India to the position of most sought-after partner on the international stage. After all, who could hug two arch-rivals- US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin with the same panache?It is difficult to think of another world leader who could tell Putin directly that this is “not the age of war,” and also persuade his foreign minister S Jaishankar to tell the arrogant West that “Europe’s problems are not the world’s problems,” while yet managing to maintain good relations with both sides.The West actually fought tooth and nail to have us on their side during the Russia-Ukraine war. India was under intense pressure from the United States to adopt a position. Despite the pressure, India resisted giving in. India remained impartial in regard to the situation between Russia and Ukraine despite pressure from the West.India’s toughness in its attitude was warmly received by the West, which was demonstrated by the fact that despite their differences, the U.S. and India have continued to have a strong collaboration in areas such as business, technology, security, and education.In June 2020, Indian and Chinese troops clashed in the Galwan Valley. The clash was the worst fighting in over four decades and resulted in severe casualties on both sides. The deaths of 20 Indian soldiers was the first time Indian Army personnel were killed on the Line of Actual Control since October 1975.China, still celebrating its victory in 1962, blatantly misjudged India’s resolve to oppose its land-grabbing strategies this time. Beijing was shocked when the Modi administration chose to protect India’s frontiers.At first, India and China had multiple rounds of discussions, both officially in Delhi and Beijing and at the level of military commanders on the LAC. However, when it became clear that China would not back down, India made the decision to establish trade limitations on Chinese investors and goods.The Indian government, led by Prime Minister Modi, authorized the Indian Army to respond to any further escalation on the front lines in a responsible manner. An example of this was the aggressive occupation of specific heights by Indian troops near the Pangong Tso on August 5, 2020, which caught China off guard.With its handling of China’s Galwan misadventure, India once again demonstrated to the world that it is no longer a nation to be taken lightly.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

101,"20 October, 2023 ",India rejects Canada’s accusations of violating Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations by removing 41 diplomats,"""We reject any attempt to portray the Implementation of parity as a violation of International norms,"" the Indian Ministry of External Affairs clarified.On Friday (20th October), the Indian Ministry of External Affairs rejected the Canadian government’s claim that India violated the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations by asking Canada to remove 41 diplomats.In a statement, MEA made it clear, “We have seen the Statement by the Government of Canada on October 19 regarding Canadian diplomatic presence in India. The state of our bilateral relations, the much higher number of Canadian diplomats in India, and their continued interference in our internal affairs warrant a parity in mutual diplomatic presence in New Delhi and Ottawa.”“We have been engaged with the Canadian side on this over the last month In order to work out the details and modalities of its implementation…Our actions in implementing this parity are fully consistent with Article 11.1 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which states the following,” it further added.Parity in Canadian diplomatic presence in India:https://t.co/O1fqsrOx8n pic.twitter.com/WxJojOrr5DArticle 11.1 of the Vienna Convention says [pdf], “In the absence of specific agreement as to the size of the mission, the receiving State may require that the size of a mission be kept within limits considered by it to be reasonable and normal, having regard to circumstances and conditions in the receiving State and to the needs of the particular mission.”“We reject any attempt to portray the Implementation of parity as a violation of International norms,” the Indian Ministry of External Affairs clarified.Canada Foreign Minister Melanie Joly announced on Thursday (19th October) that Canada has removed 41 diplomats and their 42 family members, from India over the ongoing row between the two countries. “As of now, I can confirm that India has formally conveyed its plan to unethically remove diplomatic immunities for all but 21 Canadian diplomats and dependents in Delhi by tomorrow, October 20. This means 41 Canadian diplomats and their 42 dependents were in danger of having immunity stripped on an arbitrary date. And this would put their personal safety at risk,” Joly said, as she confirmed the departure of Canadian diplomats. This comes after India suspended visa operations to Canada and called for a reduction in Canadian diplomats in India, calling for ‘parity’, owing to the ongoing diplomatic row between the two nations. Canadian Foreign Minister said, “…We have facilitated their safe departure from India. This means that our diplomats and their families have now left diplomatic immunities. Keep diplomats safe, no matter where they’re from and where they’re sent to. Immunities allow diplomats to do their work without fear of reprisal or arrests from the country they’re in.” “They are a fundamental principle of diplomacy and this is a two-way street. They only work if every country abides by the rules. A unilateral revocation of diplomatic privilege and immunities is contrary to international law. It is a clear violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and threatening to do so is unreasonable and escalatory. If we allow the norm of diplomatic immunity to be broken no diplomats anywhere on the planet would be safe,” she said, adding that Canada “will not reciprocate,” she said, according to CTV news.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

102,"20 October, 2023 ",FIR filed against former cricketer Mohd Azharuddin and 2 others over misappropriation of Rs 3.85 crores HCA funds,"The accused have been booked with criminal breach of trust, cheating, forgery, and criminal conspiracy in violation of IPC sections 406, 409, 420, 465, 467, 469, and 120-B.On Thursday (19th October), Hyderabad Police said that criminal cases had been filed against former cricketer Mohammed Azharuddin and some other former officer bearers of the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) over alleged misappropriation of funds up to Rs 3.85 crore.Other than former HCA president Mohammed Azharuddin, those named in the FIR are former secretary R Vijay Anand and former treasurer Surender Agarwal. The case against the accused persons was registered on a complaint lodged by Association Chief Executive Officer Suneel Kante Bose on Wednesday.The accused persons have been booked with criminal breach of trust, cheating, forgery, and criminal conspiracy in violation of IPC sections 406, 409, 420, 465, 467, 469, and 120-B.They have been accused of misappropriating money while procuring gym equipment, cricket balls, fire extinguishers, and bucket seats for the HCA’s premises as well as the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium.The alleged misappropriation of HCA funds and diversion of funds to private agencies under the guise of supplying material to the HCA, which occurred between March 2020 and February 2023, was discovered during a forensic audit conducted by a private firm at the request of the HCA. The forensic audit discovered financial loss, fund diversion, and misappropriation of HCA assets funds. The findings of the audit prompted Suneel Kante Bose to file a complaint against Mohammad Azharuddin and others.Reportedly, a tender for the procurement of fire safety equipment was given to M/s Firewin Safety Engineers, which quoted Rs 1,88,97,759 (exclusive of taxes) for HCA, however, a quotation acquired by the forensic auditors from a third-party expert was Rs 54,31,014. The audit discovered that the quotation was prepared at 248% higher than the existing prices, showing a significant outflow of funds beyond what should be reasonable for this item.In addition, the officer bearers chose Sara Sports, whose credentials are questionable, to obtain red and white test balls. It is also claimed that the tender procedure was handled by Mohammad Azharuddin and the then-treasurer Surender Agarwal rather than the tender committee.Despite the fact that the orders were not delivered, the vendor was paid in full, suggesting that the funds were misappropriated and diverted for their own use which led to a loss of over Rs 57 lakh.Another case is related to the purchase of bucket chairs from M/s. Excellent Enterprises. Although the agreement stated that 1100 chairs would be delivered and installed within 15 days of the order date, this was manually modified to 45 days. Reportedly, the price of each was inflated to Rs 2,568. Furthermore, only 700 seats were supplied before the deadline, with the remaining 400 chairs getting delivered after around two years. This caused HCA to suffer a loss of Rs 43,11,720. Additionally, for gym equipment procurement, an order was placed with Body Drench India Private, resulting in a price increase of Rs 1,50,37,112 (excluding taxes and outstanding dumbbell set price), suggesting over-invoicing and loss to the Hyderabad Cricket Association.Furthermore,  police have registered three additional cases in relation to the players submitting forged age certificates to play in underage teams. An investigation has been initiated into that as well.Meanwhile, Azharuddin in an X post dismissed the accusations levied against him as “false” and “motivated,” and stated that he would respond to them at the appropriate time.I have seen news reports that have reported that FIR's have been registered against me on complaints by CEO, HCA.I want to state that these are all false & motivated allegations & I am in no way connected with the allegations. I will reply to the motivated allegations against…“I have seen media reports that have reported that FIR’s have been registered against me on complaints by CEO, HCA. I want to state that these are all false & motivated allegations & I am in no way connected with the allegations. I will reply to the motivated allegations against me at an appropriate time. This is just a stunt pulled by my rivals to ruin my reputation. We shall stay strong and fight harder,” Azharuddin posted on X.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

103,"20 October, 2023 ",Cracks in I.N.D.I bloc: Akhilesh Yadav warns about the future of alliance after Congress’ refusal to share seats with SP in MP polls,"Cracks appear to widen in the unholy nexus of opposition political parties, INDI Alliance, as SP declared candidates on 31 seats in MP after falling out with Congress on the seat-sharing formula for the upcoming state polls.The Congress has humiliated Samajwadi Party President and former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, an important leader in the I.N.D.I Alliance. His party has been completely ignored in the upcoming assembly election in Madhya Pradesh which is scheduled to take place next month. Never mind the six seats that were promised, not a single seat was assigned to the Samajwadi Party which has left him belittled and furious. Following the development, he declared that he would not have attended any meetings if he had known that there was no state-level alliance. Notably, he had shared his party’s performance statistics with the former Congress Chief Minister (Kamal Nath) in the state. After discussing with other Samajwadi party leaders until one in the morning, senior Congressmen declared that they were prepared to offer six seats to the former in the state polls.According to Akhilesh Yadav, the Congress fielded candidates for every seat and left no room for the Samajwadi Party even after this arrangement was established. He mentioned that the matters pertaining to the general election would be seen later and stressed that he would not have attended any meeting or shared any list with the grand old party if he had been aware that there was no cooperation in the states.He noted, “A former chief minister of Madhya Pradesh asked us about our performance in the state. We told him how many seats we had won and when as well as in which seats we stood at number two. We had a comprehensive discussion. They woke up Samajwadi Party leaders even at 1 a.m. They assured us six seats. However, when the lists were announced, there were zero seats for the Samajwadi Party.”He highlighted, “If I had known on the first day that there is no alliance of I.N.D.I bloc at the assembly level then I would never have met with Congress. Our party leader wouldn’t have met or shared the list with their leaders. We would take into account if the coalition is only going to transpire in Uttar Pradesh for the Lok Sabha election.”""अगर ये मुझे पहले दिन पता होता कि विधानसभा स्तर पर कोई गठबंधन नहीं है INDIA का तो कभी मिलने नहीं जाते हमारी पार्टी के लोग और न ही हम कभी सूची देते कांग्रेस के लोगों को। गठबंधन केवल उत्तर प्रदेश में केंद्र के लिए होगा तो उसपर विचार किया जाएगा।""– माननीय राष्ट्रीय अध्यक्ष श्री… pic.twitter.com/ZdDN9ETgxwFurthermore, the Samajwadi Party announced to contest the elections on its own and has fielded its candidates in as many as 31 seats. The state in charge of the Samajwadi Party in Madhya Pradesh Vyaji Gond remarked that the party is working to nominate candidates for each of the 230 seats. The names of thirty-one candidates have been made public till now. The two parties have been in strife for the past few days, particularly since Ajay Rai, the president of the Uttar Pradesh Congress requested the Samajwadi Party to withdraw from Madhya Pradesh as it “did not have a base” there. He claimed that the battle had always been between the Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party. He added insult to injury and pointed out that the party won only one seat in 2018 and that its sole MLA in the state assembly had later switched to the latter.He added that his party is preparing to contest all 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh in 2024 which infuriated Akhilesh Yadav who cautioned the Congress against permitting its minor leaders to talk about his party. “The state chief has no authority. He was not there in the meeting held at Patna, Mumbai. What does he know about the INDIA alliance,” the SP supremo asked. He observed “These people from Congress are involved with the BJP. If I had known that the alliance is not on the state level then I would not have sent SP leaders to Digvijaya Singh. I would not have trusted them if I had known that people from Congress would betray us. Congress should not get statements made by their small-time leaders about our party.”On 17 October he emphasised that Congress needs to make clear where it stands on the alliance between the partners in the bloc and whether the sharing of seats would be applicable at the state or the national level.Interestingly, since the announcement of the I.N.D.I Alliance the rift in the opposition parties has become quite apparent. The Congress party and Aam Aadmi Party are at loggerheads both in Delhi and Punjab. Their leaders regularly attack each other on multiple issues. The Congress and the Trinamool Congress are at odds in West Bengal while in Kerala the Communist Party of India (Marxist) which is presently in government there is part of the bloc along with the opposition in the state. Now, the alliance does not appear to be doing well in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.
